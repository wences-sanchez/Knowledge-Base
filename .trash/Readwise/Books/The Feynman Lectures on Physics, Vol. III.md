## Highlights
- 

“Quantum mechanics” is the description of the behavior of matter and light in all its details and, in particular, of the happenings on an atomic scale. #flashcard  #sci #pink

 When two waves are in phase #flashcard  #sci 
    The intensity I12 observed when both holes are open is certainly not the sum of I1 and I2. We say that there is “interference” of the two waves. At some places (where the curve I12 has its maxima) the waves are “in phase” and the wave peaks add together to give a large amplitude and, therefore, a large intensity. We say that the two waves are “interfering constructively” at such places. There will be such constructive interference wherever the distance from the detector to one hole is a whole number of wavelengths larger (or shorter) than the distance from the detector to the other hole.
