  If youâ€™re responsible for setting up servers on AWS to run your infrastructure, you have many compute options. You need to know which service to use for which use case. At a fundamental level, there are three types of compute options: virtual machines, container services, and serverless. #flashcard

  When you are launching an EC2 instance, you will see something like this when selecting an instance type and size. The T3 or A1 is the instance family that determines the blend of the hardware capabilities. Then there's the dot. Then there's the size like small, medium, large. It goes down to nano and up to many, many extra large sizes, depending on the instance type. #flashcard

  AWS does not charge usage or data transfer fees for your instance after you stop it, but storage for any Amazon EBS volumes is still charged. While your instance is in the stopped state, you can modify some attributes, like the instance type. When you stop your instance, the data stored in memory (RAM) is lost. #flashcard
