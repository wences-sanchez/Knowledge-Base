   What are the most proper versioning numbers? #flashcard 
    Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
     MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
     MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible
     manner
     PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
     Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
     to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
