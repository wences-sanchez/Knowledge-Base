  Traditionally software testing was overly manual work done by deploying your application to a test environment and then performing some black-box style testing e.g. by clicking through your user interface to see if anything's broken. Often these tests would be specified by test scripts to ensure the testers would do consistent checking.
     It's obvious that testing all changes manually is time-consuming, repetitive and tedious. Repetitive is boring, boring leads to mistakes and makes you look for a different job by the end of the week.
