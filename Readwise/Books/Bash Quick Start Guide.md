Sourcing the script means to use the Bash source command to read all of the commands in a script into the current shell session and run them there. A source command to read in a script such asÂ hello.bash might look like this:
     bash$ source hello.bash
     Hello, bashuser! #flashcard

### Arguments to scripts
