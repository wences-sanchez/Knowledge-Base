  Classical physics includes Newton’s equations for the motion of particles, the Maxwell-Faraday theory of electromagnetic fields, and Einstein’s general theory of relativity. #flashcard

  The job of classical mechanics is to predict the future. #flashcard

  In classical physics, if you know everything about a system at some instant of time, and you also know the equations that govern how the system changes, then you can predict the future. That’s what we mean when we say that the classical laws of physics are deterministic. If we can say the same thing, but with the past and future reversed, then the same equations tell you everything about the past. Such a system is called reversible. #flashcard

#### SIMPLE DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS AND THE SPACE OF STATES

  A system that changes with time is called a dynamical system. A dynamical system consists of more than a space of states. It also entails a law of motion, or dynamical law. The dynamical law is a rule that tells us the next state given the current state. #flashcard

  The variables describing a system are called its degrees of freedom. Our coin has one degree of freedom, which we can denote by the greek letter sigma, . #flashcard

  Because in each case the future behavior is completely determined by the initial state, such laws are deterministic. All the basic laws of classical mechanics are deterministic. #flashcard

  Nevertheless, this law is completely deterministic. Wherever you start, the future is determined. For example, if you start at 2, the history will be 2, 6, 1, 2, 6, 1, … #flashcard

#### RULES THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED: THE MINUS-FIRST LAW

  According to the rules of classical physics, not all laws are legal. It’s not enough for a dynamical law to be deterministic; it must also be reversible. #flashcard

   It is no possible for a graph to have more than one input and one output for every single vertex. #flashcard 
    The meaning of reversible—in the context of physics—can be described a few different ways. The most concise description is to say that if you reverse all the arrows, the resulting law is still deterministic. Another way, is to say the laws are deterministic into the past as well as the future.

  There is a very simple rule to tell when a diagram represents a deterministic reversible law. If every state has a single unique arrow leading into it, and a single arrow leading out of it, then it is a legal deterministic reversible law. #flashcard

  There must be one arrow to tell you where you’re going and one to tell you where you came from. #flashcard

  We could call it the first law, but unfortunately there are already two first laws—Newton’s and the first law of thermodynamics. #flashcard

   It's simply a memory from where we started. Something with doesn't change with time. #flashcard 
    The conservation of information is simply the rule that every state has one arrow in and one arrow out. It ensures that you never lose track of where you started.

  Whenever a dynamical law divides the state-space into such separate cycles, there is a memory of which cycle they started in. Such a memory is called a conservation law; it tells us that something is kept intact for all time. #flashcard

  In principle we cannot know the initial conditions with infinite precision. In most cases the tiniest differences in the initial conditions—the starting state—leads to large eventual differences in outcomes. This phenomenon is called chaos. #flashcard

  If a system is chaotic (most are), then it implies that however good the resolving power may be, the time over which the system is predictable is limited. Perfect predictability is not achievable, simply because we are limited in our resolving power. #flashcard

   What is a radian? #flashcard  #learn 
    Instead we use the radian; we say that there are 2 radians in 360°, or 1 radian = /180°, thus 90° = /2 radians, and 30° = /6 radians. Thus a radian is about 57°

   What is needed for a vector? #flashcard  #learn 
    If an object is moved from some particular starting location, it is not enough to know how far it is moved in order to know where it winds up. One also has to know the direction of the displacement. Displacement is the simplest example of a vector quantity.

  Vectors can also be described in component form. We begin with three perpendicular axes x, y, z. Next, we define three unit vectors that lie along these axes and have unit length. The unit vectors along the coordinate axes are called basis vectors. The three basis vectors for Cartesian coordinates are traditionally called , , and #flashcard

  Here is the angle between the vectors. In ordinary language, the dot product is the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the cosine of the angle between them. #flashcard

  An important property of the dot product is that it is zero if the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular). #flashcard

  The concept of a point particle is an idealization. No object is so small that it is a point—not even an electron. But in many situations we can ignore the extended structure of objects and treat them as points. For example, the planet Earth is obviously not a point, but in calculating its orbit around the Sun, we can ignore the size of Earth to a high degree of accuracy. #flashcard

  The function F(T) is called the indefinite integral of f(t). It is indefinite because instead of integrating from a fixed value to a fixed value, we integrate to a variable. #flashcard
