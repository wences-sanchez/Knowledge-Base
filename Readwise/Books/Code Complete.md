  Figure 2-1. The letter-writing metaphor suggests that the software process relies on expensive trial and error rather than careful planning and design #flashcard  #blue #azul

  But extending the metaphor of "writing" software to a plan to throw one away is poor advice for software development, #flashcard

  Some programmers do know how to perform upstream activities, but they don't prepare because they can't resist the urge to begin coding as soon as possible. If you feed your horse at this trough, I have two suggestions. Suggestion 1: Read the argument in the next section. It may tell you a few things you haven't thought of. Suggestion 2: Pay attention to the problems you experience. It takes only a few large programs to learn that you can avoid a lot of stress by planning ahead. Let your own experience be your guide. #flashcard  #blue #azul

  If the manager of your project pretends to be a brigadier general and orders you to start coding right away, it's easy to say, "Yes, Sir!" (What's the harm? The old guy must know what he's talking about.) This is a bad response, and you have several better alternatives. First, you can flatly refuse to do work in an ineffective order. #flashcard  #pink #rosa

  The penalty for failing to define the problem is that you can waste a lot of time solving the wrong problem. This is a double-barreled penalty because you also don't solve the right problem. #flashcard  #blue #azul

  If you can't explain something to a six-year-old, you really don't understand it yourself. — Albert Einstein #flashcard  #blue #azul

  How much design should be done with a formal design notation, and how much should be left to be done at the keyboard? When are you done? Since design is open-ended, the most common answer to that question is "When you're out of time." #flashcard  #pink #rosa

  top-down approach is the idea that the human brain can concentrate on only a certain amount of detail at a time. If you start with general classes and decompose them into more specialized classes step by step, your brain isn't forced to deal with too many details at once. #flashcard  #blue #azul

  Sometimes the top-down approach is so abstract that it's hard to get started. If you need to work with something more tangible, try the bottom-up design approach. #flashcard  #blue #azul

  Favor read-time convenience to write-time convenience. Code is read far more times than it's written, even during initial development. Favoring a technique that speeds write-time convenience at the expense of read-time convenience is a false economy. #flashcard  #blue #azul

  Avoid duplicate code. Undoubtedly the most popular reason for creating a routine is to avoid duplicate code. Indeed, creation of similar code in two routines implies an error in decomposition. #flashcard  #blue #azul

  Constructing a whole routine to contain two or three lines of code might seem like overkill, but experience shows how helpful a good small routine can be. #flashcard  #pink #rosa
