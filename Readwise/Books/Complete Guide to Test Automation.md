## Highlights
- 

Chapters 9 – 14 are written as a hands-on tutorial, in which we design and build a test automation system with few tests (using Selenium) for an existing open source project, and Chapters 15 – 19 provide guidance for using test automation in the most effective way, and how to get the most out of it. #flashcard
