- Explain the Halt-Problem. #flashcard  #cs #pink 
    The “if” in the Church-Turing thesis is important. Not all problems have computational solutions. Turing showed, for example, that it is impossible to write a program that takes an arbitrary program as input, and prints true if and only if the input program will run forever. This is known as the halting problem.

- Bisección #flashcard  #cs #blue 
    notice that at each iteration of the loop, the size of the space to be searched is cut in half. For this reason, the algorithm is called bisection search. Bisection search is a huge improvement over our earlier algorithm, which reduced the search space by only a small amount at each iteration.

- Name Scalar and Structured types in Python. #flashcard 
    The numeric types int and float are scalar types. That is to say, objects of these types have no accessible internal structure. In contrast, str can be thought of as a structured, or non-scalar, type. We can use indexing to extract individual characters from a string and slicing to extract substrings.

- Do the tuples and strings in Python...
   * have the same elements type?
   * have the same sequence behaviour? #flashcard 
    Like strings, tuples are immutable ordered sequences of elements. The difference is that the elements of a tuple need not be characters.

- What is the difference between Testing and Debugging? #flashcard 
    Testing is the process of running a program to try and ascertain whether it works as intended. Debugging is the process of trying to fix a program that you already know does not work as intended.

  Another positive feature of black-box testing is that it is robust with respect to implementation changes. Since the test data is generated without knowledge of the implementation, the tests need not be changed when the implementation is changed. #flashcard

- Steps for white-box tests #flashcard 
    Despite the limitations of glass-box testing, a few rules of thumb are usually worth following: Exercise both branches of all if statements. Make sure that each except clause (see Chapter 9) is executed. For each for loop, have test cases in which ○ The loop is not entered (e.g., if the loop is iterating over the elements of a list, make sure that it is tested on the empty list). ○ The body of the loop is executed exactly once. ○ The body of the loop is executed more than once. For each while loop ○ Look at the same kinds of cases as when dealing with for loops. ○ Include test cases corresponding to all possible ways of exiting the loop. For example, for a loop starting with   while len(L) > 0 and not L[i] == e  find cases where the loop exits because len(L) is greater than zero and cases where it exits because L[i] == e. For recursive functions, include test cases that cause the function to return with no recursive calls, exactly one recursive call, and more than one recursive call.

- Usual cycle of tests in practice #flashcard 
    Testing is often thought of as occurring in two phases. One should always start with unit testing. During this phase, testers construct and run tests designed to ascertain whether individual units of code (e.g., functions) work properly. This is followed by integration testing, which is designed to ascertain whether groups of units function properly when combined. Finally, functional testing is used to check if the program as a whole behaves as intended.

   Why is Functional Testing harder #flashcard 
    Functional testing is almost always the most challenging phase. The intended behavior of an entire program is considerably harder to characterize than the intended behavior of each of its parts. For example, characterizing the intended behavior of a word processor is considerably more challenging than characterizing the behavior of the subsystem that counts the number of characters in a document.

   Difference between 'overt' and 'covert' bugs #flashcard 
    Overt → covert: An overt bug has an obvious manifestation, e.g., the program crashes or takes far longer (maybe forever) to run than it should. A covert bug has no obvious manifestation. The program may run to conclusion with no problem—other than providing an incorrect answer.

- Differences between 'Persistent' and 'Intermittent' Bugs #flashcard

   Steps for debugging #flashcard 
    Start by studying the available data. This includes the test results and the program text. Study all of the test results. Examine not only the tests that revealed the presence of a problem, but also those tests that seemed to work perfectly. Trying to understand why one test worked and another did not is often illuminating. When looking at the program text, keep in mind that you don't completely understand it. If you did, there probably wouldn't be a bug. Next, form a hypothesis that you believe to be consistent with all the data. The hypothesis could be as narrow as “if I change line 403 from x < y to x <= y, the problem will go away” or as broad as “my program is not working because I forgot about the possibility of aliasing in multiple places.” Next, design and run a repeatable experiment with the potential to refute the hypothesis. For example, you might put a print statement before and after each loop. If these are always paired, then the hypothesis that a loop is causing nontermination has been refuted. Decide before running the experiment how you would interpret various possible results. All humans are subject to what psychologists call confirmation bias—we interpret information in a way that reinforces what we want to believe. If you wait until after you run the experiment to think about what the results should be, you are more likely to fall prey to wishful thinking. Finally, keep a record of what experiments you have tried. When you've spent many hours changing your code trying to track down an elusive bug, it's easy to forget what you have already tried. If you aren't careful, you can waste way too many hours trying the same experiment (or more likely an experiment that looks different but will give you the same information) over and over again.

- How to use the bisection search to better debugging #flashcard 
    Often the best way to do this is to conduct a bisection search. Find some point about halfway through the code, and devise an experiment that will allow you to decide if there is a problem before that point that might be related to the symptom.

- Tip for a better approach in Testing #flashcard  #pink 
    Stop asking yourself why the program isn't doing what you want it to. Instead, ask yourself why it is doing what it is. That should be an easier question to answer, and will probably be a good first step in figuring out how to fix the program.

- When you think you have found a bug in your code, the temptation to start coding and testing a fix is almost irresistible. It is often better, however, to pause. Remember that the goal is not to fix one bug, but to move rapidly and efficiently towards a bug-free program. #flashcard  #pink

   What is an abstract data type? #flashcard 
    An abstract data type is a set of objects and the operations on those objects.

-
- What is the purpose of an ADT? #flashcard 
    These are bound together so that programmers can pass an object from one part of a program to another, and in doing so provide access not only to the data attributes of the object but also to operations that make it easy to manipulate that data. The specifications of those operations define an interface between the abstract data type and the rest of the program. The interface defines the behavior of the operations—what they do, but not how they do it. The interface thus provides an abstraction barrier that isolates the rest of the program from the data structures, algorithms, and code involved in providing a realization of the type abstraction. Programming is about managing complexity in a way that facilitates change. Two powerful mechanisms are available for accomplishing this: decomposition and abstraction. Decomposition creates structure in a program, and abstraction suppresses detail. The key is to suppress the appropriate details. This is where data abstraction hits the mark. We can create domain-specific types that provide a convenient abstraction. Ideally, these types capture concepts that will be relevant over the lifetime of a program.

- For simplicity, we will use a random access machine as our model of computation. In a random access machine, steps are executed sequentially, one at a time.66 A step is an operation that takes a fixed amount of time, such as binding a variable to an object, making a comparison, executing an arithmetic operation, or accessing an object in memory. #flashcard  #cs

- About Big O #flashcard  #cs 
    The most commonly used asymptotic notation is called “Big O” notation.67 Big O notation is used to give an upper bound on the asymptotic growth (often called the order of growth) of a function. For example, the formula f(x) ∈ O(x2) means that the function f grows no faster than the quadratic polynomial x2, in an asymptotic sense.
