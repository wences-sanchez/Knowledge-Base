   What is Appium? #flashcard 
    Appium is basically a web server written in Node.js. The server performs actions in the given order:
     Receives connection from client and initiates a session
     Listens for commands issued
     Executes those commands
     Returns the command execution status
     So basically, Appium is a client-server architecture.
