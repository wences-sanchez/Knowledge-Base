Testers are also on the developer team, because testing is a central component of agile software development. Testers advocate for quality on behalf of the customer and assist the development team in delivering the maximum business value. #flashcard

We both started working on agile teams at the turn of the millennium. Like a lot of testers who are new to agile, we didn’t know what to expect at first. #flashcard

Agile development has transformed the testing profession in many ways. #flashcard

I learned that my job was to help the customers tell us what was valuable to them during each iteration, and to write tests to ensure that’s what they got. #flashcard

On my first day of the project, Jonathan Rasmusson, one of the developers, came up to me and asked me why I was there. The team was practicing XP, and the programmers were practicing test-first and automating all their own tests. #flashcard

With the automation of the tedious, low-level boundary condition test cases, Janet as a tester was now free to focus on much greater value-add areas like exploratory testing, usability, and testing the app in ways developers hadn’t originally anticipated. #flashcard

Testers don’t sit and wait for work; they get up and look for ways to contribute throughout the development cycle and beyond. #flashcard

Agile is iterative and incremental. This means that the testers test each increment of coding as soon as it is finished. #flashcard

Programmers never get ahead of the testers, because a story is not “done” until it has been tested. #flashcard

While some teams do seem to use the “agile” buzzword to justify simply doing whatever they want, true agile teams are all about repeatable quality as well as efficiency. In our experience, an agile team is a wonderful place to be a tester. #flashcard

Some folks who are new to agile perceive it as all about speed. The fact is, it’s all about quality—and if it’s not, we question whether it’s really an “agile” team. #flashcard

Your situation is unique. That’s why you need to be aware of the potential testing obstacles your team might face and how you can apply agile values and principles to overcome them. #flashcard

We define an agile tester this way: a professional tester who embraces change, collaborates well with both technical and business people, and understands the concept of using tests to document requirements and drive development. #flashcard

We like to think of a test strategy as a static document that seldom changes, while a test plan is created new and is specific to each new project. #flashcard  #blue #azul

In release planning, we talk about the purpose of the release, what’s in scope, and what assumptions we’re making. We do some quick risk analysis and plan our test approach to address those risks. We consider automation and what we need for test environments and test data. We certainly want to identify milestones and deliverables. Hmmm, this is starting to sound like . . . a test plan! #flashcard
