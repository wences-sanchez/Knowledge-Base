00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,726
Hi everyone! Welcome to Dive Into Ansible. I'm James Spurin,

2
00:00:04,726 --> 00:00:07,319
and I'm your instructor for this course.

3
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,079
I've worked in the IT industry for over 20 years for many leading companies

4
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:19,956
including Nomura, Goldman Sachs, Dell EMC, when I worked there it was just EMC,

5
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:26,099
Hitachi, Virgin Internet, and one of the first ever Internet providers in the UK

6
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,175
Demon Internet. While I was working, I also studied,

7
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:35,189
and I was one of the first to complete an online Masters in Software Engineering

8
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:40,249
at Liverpool University. Personally I love OpenSource and DevOps

9
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:44,659
technology, as well as Ansible, the likes of Docker,

10
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:47,953
which we'll also make you solve on this course.

11
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,943
In the OpenSource community itself,

12
00:00:50,943 --> 00:00:54,436
I regularly give back. I'm the creator of

13
00:00:54,436 --> 00:01:01,012
XMLdataset, a library for handling XML, featured on the Awesome Python list.

14
00:01:01,012 --> 00:01:05,006
I maintain a popular Docker image for another OpenSource

15
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:08,282
software project called Hexo, a framework for

16
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:12,192
creating static websites. I also contribute

17
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,935
to a variety of OpenSource projects

18
00:01:14,935 --> 00:01:19,445
including Ansible, which of course, this course is about.

19
00:01:19,445 --> 00:01:19,463
Ansible, which of course, this course is about.

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,550
The course originally started back in 2018, as

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,589
Mastering Ansible, and since then it's been

22
00:01:26,589 --> 00:01:29,850
refreshed and updated to what you see here, as

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,050
Dive Into Ansible. I regularly review and maintain

24
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,080
it, and so far, it's supported Ansible, right

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,620
through from version 2, to the current version.

26
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,730
With this course, I bring you a fantastic lab

27
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,030
experience, which directly mirrors what I'm

28
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,170
actually using in the lessons. Where Ansible and

29
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,620
all of the associated lab hosts are directly

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:59,400
accessible from your web browser, you can run this

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,840
locally on your own system, or via Google Cloud.

32
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,090
You get your Ansible control host, free Ubuntu, and

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,750
free CentOS systems. We intentionally use

34
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,300
different Linux systems so that we can really see

35
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:19,290
the power and versatility of Ansible when

36
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,240
targeting the systems simultaneously. By the way,

37
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,030
in this course, the container images and the

38
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,820
environment that I've created for the lab are

39
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,390
also OpenSource, so these are also available for

40
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,540
you to use yourself, or even just for learning

41
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,230
purposes. Personally, I now focus full time on

42
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,540
education and content, as the founder of this

43
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,130
company, DiveInto and especially love hearing and

44
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,320
connecting with people like yourselves who

45
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,470
clearly share the same interests in technology.

46
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,590
For whatever reason, you've decided to learn

47
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,160
Ansible today, take a moment and connect with me

48
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,870
on both Twitter, and LinkedIn. This course is

49
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,680
provided with a huge library of examples that

50
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:11,310
relate to each chapter, and has been designed so

51
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,710
that you can actually work through this in the

52
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:17,820
best way that suits you. Rather than me actually

53
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:21,180
dictating how you should learn, you can actually

54
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,740
choose your own preferred learning path. So you

55
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,100
can just watch through the videos if you rapidly

56
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,550
need to learn Ansible in a short amount of time.

57
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,240
Alternatively, you can follow the course and

58
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,140
directly run and interact with all of the examples

59
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,760
yourselves in exactly the same way that I'm using

60
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,540
throughout the course. Or again, you can use the

61
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,920
content as a reference and create your own content

62
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,030
based on what is taught. Regardless of which

63
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:00,090
approach you choose, at the end, you'll also have

64
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:02,670
a full library of resources that you can make use

65
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,630
of when you're using Ansible. So onto the

66
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,870
course content; we're currently in the first

67
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,410
section and after this overview, we'll start with

68
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:18,329
an introduction to Ansible. Next, we'll install

69
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,880
Docker, which is a requirement for our lab

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,810
environment. We'll configure the Ansible lab,

71
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:28,170
we'll set up a trusted relationship between our

72
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:31,710
hosts with SSH and we'll configure the course code

73
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,530
repository. In Section three, we'll look at

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,190
Ansible architecture and design. We'll start by

75
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,790
configuring Ansible where we'll make use of the

76
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,510
awesome Ansible command line tool to validate and

77
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:48,510
test our configuration. We'll also look at

78
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,450
inventories and modules, and how we can interact

79
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,230
with modules direct from the command line. In

80
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:58,080
section four, we'll get started with Playbooks.

81
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,560
We'll take a look at YAML, the various

82
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,250
sections that make up a Playbook, the use of

83
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,810
variables and facts, how to use templating with

84
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:14,160
Jinja2, and we'll create and execute a fully

85
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,400
fledged web server and website project with

86
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,270
Ansible. In Section five, we'll take a look at

87
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,930
some of the more common Playbook modules. We'll

88
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,340
look at Dynamic Inventories, both how to use them,

89
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,540
and how to create them. The use of register and

90
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,140
when for capturing information. The various ways

91
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,560
of using loops; we'll look at the performance

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,530
aspects with different means of execution such as

93
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,420
asynchronous, serial and parallel. Task delegation,

94
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,060
how to make a task run on a specific target, and

95
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,490
support magic variables and support blocks; and the

96
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,320
Ansible Vault for securing information. In Section

97
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,350
six, we'll see how we can structure Ansible

98
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,400
Playbooks through the use of includes and imports.

99
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,440
Tags, that will allow us to reuse specific entities

100
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,950
and roles where we can break our tasks into

101
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:24,030
reusable components. In Section seven, we'll make

102
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:27,870
use of popular areas with Ansible such as AWS, and

103
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:32,340
Docker. In Section eight, we'll create our own

104
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:37,290
modules and plugins. Section nine covers other

105
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,050
Ansible resources and areas such as

106
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:44,550
troubleshooting. Lastly, section 10 is

107
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,360
supplementary, and within this other areas and

108
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,680
resources that you may find useful. So with that

109
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,130
introduction and summary, let's dive into the next

110
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,879
video, Introduction to Ansible.
