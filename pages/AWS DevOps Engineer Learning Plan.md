	- ### Module 1: Introduction to DevOps
		- People use devops to innovate and create new features faster than others.
		- > Teams supporting the software development lifecycle have traditionally been siloed. Specialized in their skill set, teams such as business, development, quality assurance, specialists, maintenance, and operations, have been separated from each other and require scheduled and rigid hand-offs. Even though these teams have a common goal of delivering and supporting the application, they also have their own priorities, tooling, and processes. It is difficult to achieve efficiencies when project members are reporting to different units and aimed for different targets.
		- #### Why do some teams initially resist adopting DevOps?
			- Reluctance to DevOps adoption is natural because DevOps will bring change and disrupt the way you work and interact with others. DevOps will have organizational and team-level impact. To overcome this reluctance, it is important to understand the value of DevOps, and set realistic expectations for the teams. To be successful, you need buy-in across the organization and development teams.
		- #### Knowledge Check
			- Select the answer that best describes DevOps:
			  
			  [ ] DevOps is the combination of development and operations teams, where members
			  of each team must learn to develop, test, and deploy the software.
			  
			  [ ] DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that 
			  increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services
			   at high velocity.
			  
			  [ ] DevOps is a set of development and operations tools that automate the software development process.
			  
			  [ ] DevOps is the coordination between the development and operations teams to 
			  improve communication between the teams to develop software more 
			  efficiently. #flashcard
				- [x] DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that 
				  increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services
				   at high velocity.
		- #### Summary
