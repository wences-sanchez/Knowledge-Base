	- look at the Android design website (http://developer.android.com/design/). ([Location 416](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=416))

	- Start with your users’ goals to define exactly what your app should do. ([Location 430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=430))
	- Do One Thing and Do It Well ([Location 434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=434))
	- The more narrowly focused your app is, the easier it is to make sure that it does what it is supposed to and that it does so well. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=435))

	- list everything you want it to do. Next, start crossing off the least important things in that list until you have narrowed it down to just the absolute essentials. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=436))
		- **Tags**: #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- You are probably ready when you can answer the question, “Why would someone use this app?” ([Location 439](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=439))
		- **Tags**: #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- start with a single focus and make that part of the app excellent before moving on. ([Location 452](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=452))
		- **Tags**: #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- Intents, which is the class Android uses to indicate what the user is trying to do and to find an appropriate app to accomplish that objective. ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=464))
		- **Tags**: #[[orange]] #[[naranja]]
	- Is it an app for a particular site? Have it handle links for that site. Does it let the user modify images? Handle any Intent for working with an image. ([Location 465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=465))

	- If Google Plus is important to a user, that user will have the app installed. With just a couple lines of work, you can present a dialog to the user (Figure 1.9), which supports far more services than you’d want to develop code for. ([Location 470](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=470))
	- Why would you spend a week developing some tolerable sharing tools when you can pass that work off to the user’s favorite apps? ([Location 477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=477))
	- “Save File” instead of “Okay,” ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=485))
	- When the user presses a “delete” button, in 99% of cases, the user meant to press that button. Don’t ask the user “Did you really mean to do that thing you just did?” Assume the user meant to, but make it easy to undo the action. ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=508))
	- When in doubt, follow the user experience expectations of the platform. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=515))

	- You will work with the Toolbar class throughout this book. It is a concrete implementation available in the support library that makes an app bar as easy as any view and it has built-in support for creating menus. ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=592))
	- most work that you do to support a variety of devices will be done simply by providing alternate layouts for different devices. ([Location 618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=618))
	- all you have to know now is that you should not use the menu key. ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=645))

	- android:id="@+id/example". The “at” symbol (@) signifies that you’re referring to a resource rather than providing a literal value. The plus (+) indicates that you are creating a new resource reference; without it, you’re referring to an existing resource reference. Then comes id, defining what type of resource it is (more on this in Chapter 4). Finally, you have the name of the resource, example. ([Location 710](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=710))
	- this is just a reference to an int, which makes resource identifiers very efficient. ([Location 720](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=720))
	- density-independent pixels (abbreviated as dp or dip) ([Location 763](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=763))
	- (sp). Think of scale-independent pixels as the same as density-independent pixels but with the user’s preferred scaling applied on top. In most cases, 1sp is the same as 1dp, but a user might prefer to have fonts bigger, so they’re easier to read, or even smaller to see more on the screen. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=818))
	- A standard button following the Material Design guidelines uses a medium font (which is a font partway between normal and bold), all caps, and 14sp. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=864))

	- only one of a given listener is registered at a time. ([Location 1036](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1036))
	- ViewGroup provides the standardized methods for these classes to use so that they can perform tasks such as adding, removing, getting, and counting child views. ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1085))

	- RelativeLayout itself. Not only is this an extremely efficient way to create semicomplex layouts that adapt to a variety of screens, it also allows you to create overlapping views and views that appear to float on top of others. ([Location 1191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1191))

	- AdapterView ([Location 1203](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1203))
		- **Tags**: #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- GridView ([Location 1231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1231))
		- **Tags**: #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- Spinner is often a good solution. This class shows the currently selected choice and, when tapped, presents a drop-down menu of all the choices. ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1239))
	- ViewPager ([Location 1287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1287))

	- One of the ways Google has combated the challenge of developing software for an operating system that evolves extremely rapidly and yet is frequently not up to date on most devices is the support library. ([Location 1651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1651))
	- Occasionally you need to align views in a dynamic or complex grid and using relative layouts or nested linear layouts is problematic. In these cases, using the GridLayout class can be a good solution. ([Location 1723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1723))

	- adjustments for things such as the size of the screen and the orientation of the device. By using resource “qualifiers,” you can let Android take care of this for you. ([Location 1780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1780))
	- To avoid this situation, make sure your default directory (i.e., the one without qualifiers) contains all references. ([Location 1854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1854))

	- PNGs and GIFs use lossless compression ([Location 1896](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1896))
		- **Tags**: #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- You should never hard-code any user-facing strings, dimensions, or any other value that can be specified in resources. ([Location 2511](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=2511))
