	- -
	- look at the Android design website (http://developer.android.com/design/). #flashcard

	- The more narrowly focused your app is, the easier it is to make sure that it does what it is supposed to and that it does so well. #flashcard

	- -
	- -
	- list everything you want it to do. Next, start crossing off the least important things in that list until you have narrowed it down to just the absolute essentials. #flashcard

	- You are probably ready when you can answer the question, “Why would someone use this app?” #flashcard

	- -
	- -
	- start with a single focus and make that part of the app excellent before moving on. #flashcard

	- Intents, which is the class Android uses to indicate what the user is trying to do and to find an appropriate app to accomplish that objective. #flashcard

		- ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=464))

	- Is it an app for a particular site? Have it handle links for that site. Does it let the user modify images? Handle any Intent for working with an image. #flashcard

	- If Google Plus is important to a user, that user will have the app installed. With just a couple lines of work, you can present a dialog to the user (Figure 1.9), which supports far more services than you’d want to develop code for. #flashcard

	- Why would you spend a week developing some tolerable sharing tools when you can pass that work off to the user’s favorite apps? #flashcard

	- “Save File” instead of “Okay,” #flashcard

	- When the user presses a “delete” button, in 99% of cases, the user meant to press that button. Don’t ask the user “Did you really mean to do that thing you just did?” Assume the user meant to, but make it easy to undo the action. #flashcard

	- You will work with the Toolbar class throughout this book. It is a concrete implementation available in the support library that makes an app bar as easy as any view and it has built-in support for creating menus. #flashcard

	- most work that you do to support a variety of devices will be done simply by providing alternate layouts for different devices. #flashcard

	- -
	- all you have to know now is that you should not use the menu key. #flashcard

	- android:id="@+id/example". The “at” symbol (@) signifies that you’re referring to a resource rather than providing a literal value. The plus (+) indicates that you are creating a new resource reference; without it, you’re referring to an existing resource reference. Then comes id, defining what type of resource it is (more on this in Chapter 4). Finally, you have the name of the resource, example. #flashcard

	- this is just a reference to an int, which makes resource identifiers very efficient. #flashcard

	- density-independent pixels (abbreviated as dp or dip) #flashcard

	- (sp). Think of scale-independent pixels as the same as density-independent pixels but with the user’s preferred scaling applied on top. In most cases, 1sp is the same as 1dp, but a user might prefer to have fonts bigger, so they’re easier to read, or even smaller to see more on the screen. #flashcard

	- A standard button following the Material Design guidelines uses a medium font (which is a font partway between normal and bold), all caps, and 14sp. #flashcard

	- only one of a given listener is registered at a time. #flashcard

	- ViewGroup provides the standardized methods for these classes to use so that they can perform tasks such as adding, removing, getting, and counting child views. #flashcard

	- RelativeLayout itself. Not only is this an extremely efficient way to create semicomplex layouts that adapt to a variety of screens, it also allows you to create overlapping views and views that appear to float on top of others. #flashcard

	- Spinner is often a good solution. This class shows the currently selected choice and, when tapped, presents a drop-down menu of all the choices. #flashcard
		- ([Location 1239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1239))

	- One of the ways Google has combated the challenge of developing software for an operating system that evolves extremely rapidly and yet is frequently not up to date on most devices is the support library. #flashcard

	- -
	- Occasionally you need to align views in a dynamic or complex grid and using relative layouts or nested linear layouts is problematic. In these cases, using the GridLayout class can be a good solution. #flashcard

	- adjustments for things such as the size of the screen and the orientation of the device. By using resource “qualifiers,” you can let Android take care of this for you. #flashcard
		- ([Location 1780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B018BI07P0&location=1780))
	- -
	- -
	- To avoid this situation, make sure your default directory (i.e., the one without qualifiers) contains all references. #flashcard

	- You should never hard-code any user-facing strings, dimensions, or any other value that can be specified in resources. #flashcard
