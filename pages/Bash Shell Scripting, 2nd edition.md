- STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR are file descriptors. They are flexible and dynamically allocated.
-
- A way of getting info about commands is: `help <command>`
-
- If you put any character just after the name of a variable, the shell will believe that is part of the name and will do nothing but prints a space
-
- **alias** is a Bash internal command that allows us to define our own ones to sum up tasks
	- With `alias` you can print all the aliased commands
	- With `alias brief='my command'` you can write your own alias
