-
- STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR are file descriptors. They are flexible and dynamically allocated.
-
- A way of getting info about commands is: `help|info|man <command>`
-
- If you put any character just after the name of a variable, the shell will believe that is part of the name and will do nothing but prints a space
-
- **alias** is a Bash internal command that allows us to define our own ones to sum up tasks
	- With `alias` you can print all the aliased commands
	- With `alias brief='my command'` you can write your own alias
	- With `unalias <alias>` you can delete a created alias
-
- Bash startup files are used to provide default settings for the operating system enviroment.
	- These startup files are shell scripts themselves
		- **/etc/profile** is a generic startup fiel that is started for every login shell
		- **/etc/bashrc** is a generic startup file that is started when opening a subshell
		- User specific files are:
			- **~/.bash_profile**
			- **~/.bashrc**
- Bourne shell (**/bin/sh**) was the original shell
- Bash is Bourn Again SHell, a remake of the original Bourne shell that was invented in the 70's
	- The default shell on most Linux distros
- About exit codes:
	- If 0, the command was executed successfully
	- If 1, there was a generic error
	- The developer of a program can decide to code other exit codes as well
		- This is done by **exit n**

- #### Flashcards
	- Explain what is alias #flashcard
		- **alias** is a Bash internal command that allows us to define our own ones to sum up tasks
			- With `alias` you can print all the aliased commands
			- With `alias brief='my command'` you can write your own alias
			- With `unalias <alias>` you can delete a created alias
-
	- Name the files which contain the default settings of the shell boots #flashcard

- ### Lesson 3: Shell scripts in a DevOps environment
-
- The purpose of DevOps is to shorten the system development life cycle.

-
- **Idempotency** is a very important aspect
-
- **printf** exists in Bash because of C-Shell, which was C code.
-
- For more advanced and more complex tasks, it might have sense develop a **Python** script. But **Bash** will be native (and maybe more suitable for not-so-complex tasks), so in the real world you have to learn both.

- ### Lesson 4: Learning Linux Essentials for Shell Scripting
-
	- The command in Bash for printing message and be respectful about special characters is:
		- **echo -e** is for special characters
		- `$ echo -e "Estoy partido\nen dos"`
		- **printf** is an alternative, but is more like C-Shell...
-
	- **printf** does not print a new line character by default.
		- It's more complicated because of its syntax.
		- That's because many people prefer using **echo -e**
		- But try to avoid it because it's a little tricky ðŸ˜‰.
	- #### Grep command
		- **grep** is an external command that helps you filter text
		- It's recommended to put the text pattern between **single quotes** to avoid interpretation by the shell**!!!**
			- **Because we don't want those regular expressions to be interpreted by the shell.**
		- You can use -B n and -A n where n is the number of lines before and after the match in its context
		- If you use -l the output shows only the name of the matched files
