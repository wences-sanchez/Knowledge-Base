-
- STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR are file descriptors. They are flexible and dynamically allocated.
-
- A way of getting info about commands is: `help|info|man <command>`
-
- If you put any character just after the name of a variable, the shell will believe that is part of the name and will do nothing but prints a space
-
- **alias** is a Bash internal command that allows us to define our own ones to sum up tasks
	- With `alias` you can print all the aliased commands
	- With `alias brief='my command'` you can write your own alias
	- With `unalias <alias>` you can delete a created alias
-
- Bash startup files are used to provide default settings for the operating system enviroment.
	- These startup files are shell scripts themselves
		- **/etc/profile** is a generic startup fiel that is started for every login shell
		- **/etc/bashrc** is a generic startup file that is started when opening a subshell
		- User specific files are:
			- **~/.bash_profile**
			- **~/.bashrc**
- Bourne shell (**/bin/sh**) was the original shell
- Bash is Bourn Again SHell, a remake of the original Bourne shell that was invented in the 70's
	- The default shell on most Linux distros
- About exit codes:
	- If 0, the command was executed successfully
	- If 1, there was a generic error
	- The developer of a program can decide to code other exit codes as well
		- This is done by **exit n**
