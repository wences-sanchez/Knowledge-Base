- ## Course Introduction
	- ### Introduction to Test Selection and Test Adequacy
		- **Test Selection** is: choosing the right inputs to use to test my program
		- **Test Adequacy** is: are those inputs any good?
			- This is very difficult. Correctness is generally impossible
			- So we measure adequacy indirectly by: program structure, program inputs, requirements...
		- #### Terminology
			- **Test Case:** A set of inputs, execution conditions, and a pass/fail criterion.
			- **Test Case Specification:** A requirement to be satisfied by one or more test cases.
			- **Test Obligation:** A partial test case specification, requiring some property deemed important to thorough testing.
			- **Test Suite:** A set of test cases.
			- **Test or Test Execution:** The activity of executing test cases and evaluating their results.
			- **Adequacy Criterion:** A predicate that is true (satisfied) or false (not satisfied) of a (program, test suite) pair.
	- ### What are Test Obligations?
		- Test Obligations come from:
			- **Functional:** From software specifications
			- **Fault-based:** From hypothesized faults (common bugs)
			- **Model-based:** From model of system
			- **Structural (white or glass box):** From code

- ## Factors Influencing Test Effectiveness
	- ### Factors Influencing Test Effectiveness
		- The Oracle is an important part of the testing process.
	- ### Program Structure: Reachability and Observability
	- ### Mutation Testing Revisited
		- We kill a mutant if its value produced is different than the value produced by the original program.
		- If the tests all pass, you have a problem!
	- ### Program Structure and Fault Finding
		- You have to look at the location of the mutants, because they can become almost unreachable.
