- ## Course Introduction
	- ### Introduction to Test Selection and Test Adequacy
		- **Test Selection** is: choosing the right inputs to use to test my program
		- **Test Adequacy** is: are those inputs any good?
			- This is very difficult. Correctness is generally impossible
			- So we measure adequacy indirectly by: program structure, program inputs, requirements...
		- #### Terminology
			- **Test Case:** A set of inputs, execution conditions, and a pass/fail criterion.
			- **Test Case Specification:** A requirement to be satisfied by one or more test cases.
			- **Test Obligation:** A partial test case specification, requiring some property deemed important to thorough testing.
			- **Test Suite:** A set of test cases.
			- **Test or Test Execution:** The activity of executing test cases and evaluating their results.
			- **Adequacy Criterion:** A predicate that is true (satisfied) or false (not satisfied) of a (program, test suite) pair.
	- ### What are Test Obligations?
		- Test Obligations come from:
			- **Functional:** From software specifications
			- **Fault-based:** From hypothesized faults (common bugs)
			- **Model-based:** From model of system
			- **Structural (white or glass box):** From code
