	- “But wait!” you say. “If I don’t do what my manager says, I’ll be fired.” Probably not. Most managers want the truth, even when they don’t act like it. Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion. #flashcard

	- You will not make the deadline by making the mess. Indeed, the mess will slow you down instantly, and will force you to miss the deadline. #flashcard

	- This “code-sense” is the key. Some of us are born with it. Some of us have to fight to acquire it. #flashcard

	- Our code should be matter-of-fact as opposed to speculative. It should contain only what is necessary. #flashcard
		- ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B001GSTOAM&location=651))
	- -
	- -
	- I also look at whether an object or method is doing more than one thing. If it’s an object, it probably needs to be broken into two or more objects. #flashcard

	- There is no escape from this logic. You cannot write code if you cannot read the surrounding code. #flashcard

	- -
	- -
	- Passing a boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice. It immediately complicates the signature of the method, loudly proclaiming that this function does more than one thing. It does one thing if the flag is true and another if the flag is false! #flashcard

	- Procedural code (code using data structures) makes it easy to add new functions without changing the existing data structures. OO code, on the other hand, makes it easy to add new classes without changing existing functions. #flashcard

	- unfortunate hybrid structures that are half object and half data structure. They have functions that do significant things, and they also have either public variables or public accessors and mutators that, for all intents and purposes, make the private variables public, tempting other external functions to use those variables the way a procedural program would use a data structure.4 #flashcard

	- a class should begin with a list of variables. Public static constants, if any, should come first. Then private static variables, followed by private instance variables. There is seldom a good reason to have a public variable. Public functions should follow the list of variables. We like to put the private utilities called by a public function right after the public function itself. #flashcard
