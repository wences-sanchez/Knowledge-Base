- ## 1. Understanding Persistence
	- Sometimes, it's a good idea to keep the data separated from the server. But just as **stubs**.
		- But it's very important to be aware that those data should never be in json files, but in memory.
	- As soon as we have a bunch of servers that have to be consistent amongst them, the importance of keeping data as just one unit becomes obvious.
		- Additionally, if we have so much amount of data, it's slow.
		- We strongly need a way of treating our data correctly ==> databases
	- Databases allow us to uncouple our systems.

- ## 2. Database Basics
	- ### NoSQL - Simple Key:Value Stores
		- They're very popular
		- They have our data as a key-value pair, so they can quickly get our searches.
		- They're very easy to scale out.
		- And they allow us to change our data model (something that SQL-based can't)
			- Although this is not a very good idea and leads to technical debt.
	- ### Relational Databases - Structured and Queryable Datastores
		- **SQL** stands for *Structured Query Languange*
		- They're are easier to scale up than NoSQL
		- They're lower when grow
		-
- ## 3. Provisioning a Cloud Database
	- We use the *postbird* tool to interact with our RDS (PostgreSQL) Database
		- **Postbird** is used to interact with a PostgreSQL database

- ## 4. Filestore Basics
	- **Filestores** allow us to store big amounts of data (like images, videos and documents) that are too expensive to save them in databases.
	- We don't want to store any big file nor object nor image nor document in our database

	- ### S3 is a filestore
	- Buckets are a simple directory-like system in which to store data.
	- We can access our buckets (which are filestores) directly bypassing the server. That's great!
