- # Cloud Basics
	- ## 1. Cloud Basics and Parts of a Cloud
		- ### Defining Our Cloud
			- Cloud can be used for a variety of purposes:
				- Store data of all users into a central store
				- Scale our data store
				- Compute very hard math and cost problems
				- Parallelize compute power
				-
	- ## 2. Monolithic vs. Loosely Coupled Systems
		- Traditionally, the different features were inside a single web server
		- Often, those systems were **tightly coupled**.
			- Tightly coupled systems are **quick to stand-up**, but may result in higher **Technical Debt**.
		- It's a much better idea to use **loosely coupled** systems
			- Loosely coupled systems require more time upfront but are generally easier to improve upon.
		- What are microservices? #flashcard
			- Microservices are individual specialized systems (software deployed on specialized infrastructure) designed to accomplish a specific task.  Specific tasks may include things like authentication, image processing, or data management.
