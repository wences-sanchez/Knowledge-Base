		- Define cloud computing #flashcard
			- *“Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. This cloud model is composed of five essential characteristics, three service models, and four deployment models.”*
			  
			  This book provides a more concise definition:
			  
			  *“Cloud computing is a specialized form of distributed computing that introduces utilization models for remotely provisioning scalable and measured resources.”*

		- Grid Computing
		  
		  A computing grid (or “computational grid”) provides a platform in which computing resources are organized into one or more logical pools. These pools are collectively coordinated to provide a high performance distributed grid, sometimes referred to as a “super virtual computer.” Grid computing differs from clustering in that grid systems are much more loosely coupled and distributed. As a result, grid computing systems can involve computing resources that are heterogeneous and geographically dispersed, which is generally not possible with cluster computing-based systems. #flashcard

		- The driving motivation behind cloud computing is to provide IT resources as services that encapsulate other IT resources, while offering functions for clients to use and leverage remotely. A multitude of models for generic types of cloud services have emerged, most of which are labeled with the “as-a-service” suffix. #flashcard

		- Benefits of the cloud (academically described): #flashcard
			- Common measurable benefits to cloud consumers include:
			  
			  • On-demand access to pay-as-you-go computing resources on a short-term basis (such as processors by the hour), and the ability to release these computing resources when they are no longer needed.
			  
			  • The perception of having unlimited computing resources that are available on demand, thereby reducing the need to prepare for provisioning.
			  
			  • The ability to add or remove IT resources at a fine-grained level, such as modifying available storage disk space by single gigabyte increments.
			  
			  • Abstraction of the infrastructure so applications are not locked into devices or locations and can be easily moved if needed.

		- A simple example of usage demand fluctuations throughout a 24 hour period is provided in [Figure 3.8](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/24323849#ch03fig08).

		  The inherent, built-in feature of clouds to provide flexible levels of scalability to IT resources is directly related to the aforementioned proportional costs benefit. Besides the evident financial gain to the automated reduction of scaling, the ability of IT resources to always meet and fulfill unpredictable usage demands avoids potential loss of business that can occur when usage thresholds are met. #flashcard

		- Summary of Key Points
		  
		  • Cloud environments are comprised of highly extensive infrastructure that offers pools of IT resources that can be leased using a pay-for-use model whereby only the actual usage of the IT resources is billable. When compared to equivalent on-premise environments, clouds provide the potential for reduced initial investments and operational costs proportional to measured usage.
		  
		  • The inherent ability of a cloud to scale IT resources enables organizations to accommodate unpredictable usage fluctuations without being limited by pre-defined thresholds that may turn away usage requests from customers. Conversely, the ability of a cloud to decrease required scaling is a feature that relates directly to the proportional costs benefit.
		  
		  • By leveraging cloud environments to make IT resources highly available and reliable, organizations are able to increase quality-of-service guarantees to customers and further reduce or avoid potential loss of business resulting from unanticipated runtime failures. #flashcard
