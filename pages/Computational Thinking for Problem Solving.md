- ## [[Computational Thinking for Problem Solving/Week 1: Pillars of Computational Thinking]]
	- ## 1.1 Introduction
		- Computational thinking is not just about computers at all.
		- This course does not teach Programming (is that good or bad? I'll tell you in a while)
	- ## 1.2 Decomposition
		- Computational Thinking is an approach to solving problems using concepts and ideas from computer science.

		- Rather than begin from start to finish, you probably start by developing an outline of the essay. Instead of making all at a time.
		- You start with the main ideas, later you decompose in smaller tasks.
			- If you had to map the Earth, you won't be able to do all at once. You have to start with the satellites, later distribute them across the planet, add functionalities, zoom....
		- **Decomposition** means breaking a complex problem into more manageable sub-problems
			- Putting the solutions to the sub-problems together gives a solution to the original, complex problem.
			- **Decomposition** is NOT about *generalizing upon a smaller point*. That's another approach
			- Also, the sub-tasks have to be related to the main problem. Completely different items are not allowed.
		-
		- ### Applying Decomposition in Your Life
			- Think of a problem for which you could use computational thinking, describe it, and then describe how you would apply decomposition. You should describe at least 2 sub-problems.
				- 1. Learn Cloud Computing
					- 1.1 Study Computing in general (i.e. DevOps)
					- 1.2 Study the fundamentals of Cloud Computing
				- 2. Practice programming a lot
					- 2.1 Study the concepts of Software Development
					- 2.2 Coding a lot
				- 3. Contact with the recruiters for a possible vacancy
					- 3.1 Make an outstanding CV
					- 3.2 Ask to anyone who has a potential offer
	- ## 1.3 Pattern Recognition

		- The second pillar of Computational Thinking is **Pattern Recognition**.
			- When we decompose the problem, we frequently find patterns among the sub-problems.
				- For example, similarities or shared characteristics.
			- Discovering these patterns make the complex problem easier to solve since we can use the same solution for each occurrence of the pattern.
		- Although the parts of the problem can be different from one another, some of them might share common parts.
			- Identify those parts is what we call **Pattern Recognition**.
			- We can use the same solution for each occurrence of the pattern.

		- But first, we have to understand what data is needed to solve the sub-problems and that's what we'll see in *Data Representation and Abstraction*'s lesson.
		- ### Pregunta:
			- **[True/False] The following captures the definition of pattern recognition:**
				- *Pattern recognition is the process in which one looks for repeated steps within a problem.*
				  collapsed:: true
					- ~~True~~. **False**
					- > This is an aspect of pattern recognition, but is too limited. Pattern recognition is finding similarities or shared characteristics within or between problems. This includes recognizing that a problem structure may be similar to another one, and therefore can be solved in a similar way.
					-
		- ### Applying Pattern Recognition in Your Life
			- Think of a problem for which you could use computational thinking, describe it, and then describe how you would apply pattern recognition.
				- I am trying to study and learn a variety of computing topics.
				  
				  I would apply pattern recognition by realizing that I take the same steps when learning something.
				- Those patterns are:
					- I study a lesson (either video or textbook lesson).
					- I memorize its contents.
					- I try to explain to myself the contents to check if I have understood it.
					- I apply spaced repetition to reinforce it over time.

	- ## 1.4 Data Representation and Abstraction
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1676633927096_0.png)
		- **Data Representation and abstraction** involves determining what characteristics of the problem are important and filtering out those that are not.
		- We have to decide which information is important and which not:

		- We can also prioritize those components that **maximize satisfaction**.
