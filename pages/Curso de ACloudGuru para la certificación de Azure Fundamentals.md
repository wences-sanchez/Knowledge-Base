	- ### The Language of Cloud Computing #flashcard
	  id:: 638e17e3-b213-42c8-8bba-aa0353a44391
		- #### High Availability
			- In traditional computing,
				- you own the hardware.
				- Your have physical access
				- Your can't just add servers
			- In the cloud,
				- You don't own the hardware
				- You add more servers with a click
				- If hardware fails, replace it instantly
				- You use clusters to ensure high availabiltiy
		- #### Scalability
			- Automatically adjust resources to meet demand
			- Tipically used with a load balancer
		- #### Predictability
			- Predictable Performance
				- Consistent experience for customers regardless of traffic
				- Autoscaling, load balancing and HA provide a consistent experience
			- Predictable Costs
				- No unexpected surprises
				- Track and forecast resource usage (costs) in real time
				- Analytics tools offered
		- #### Reliability
			- a.k.a. Fault Tolerance or Disaster Recovery
			- Resilience
				- The ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function
			- Deploy in Multiple Locations
				- Protects against regional failure/disaster
			- No single point of Failure
				- Resources in multiple locations
				- If one serever goes down, others pick up the load
		- #### Security
			- Full control of the security of your cloud environment
		- #### Governance
			- Standardized environmentss
			- Regulatory audit for compliance
		- #### Manageability
			- Management **OF** the cloud:
				- Autoscaling

	- ### The Economy of Cloud Computing #flashcard
	  id:: 638e17e3-7c6a-4ce2-965b-64330e6768f5
		- #### Capital Expenditure
			- Money spent by a business or organization on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings and equipment.
			- Large upfront investments
			- Also known as **CapEx**
				- Buying hardware outright, paid upfront as a one time purchase
		- #### Operational Expenditure
			- An ongoing cost for running a product, business or system on a day-to-day basis including annual costs
			- Pay-as-you-go
			- Also known as **OpEx**
				- Ongoing costs needed to run your business
				-
	- ### Cloud Service Models #flashcard
	  id:: 638e17e3-8add-4f19-8512-fd231e56f8c9
		- #### Infrastructure as a Service
			- Infrastructure of virtual servers used as actual servers
			- Scaling is fast
			- No ownership of hardware
			- Examples:
				- VMs and Servers
				- Networks
				- Physical buildings
		-
		- #### Platform as a Service
			- It is a super set of IaaS, and like IaaS, PaaS includes infrastructure, service, storage, and networking. But also middleware, development tools, business intelligence (or BI), services, database management systems, and more.
			- PaaS is designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing,
			  deploying, managing, and updating.
			- On Azure, the PaaS offering avoids the expense and complexity of buying and managing software licenses, the underlying application infrastructure, and middleware.
			- The cloud provider manages for you the VMs and servers, the network and the physical buildings
			- You manage the applications and services that you develop
			- And the cloud service provider typically manages everything else.
			- You just have to worry about your application.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669982712481_0.png)
		-
		- #### Software as a Service
			- It implicitly includes both IaaS and PaaS, and it is built on top of those.
			- Normally, it has to do with providing a service via a managed rented software service, such as Stripe for credit card payments, Gmail for emails, or QuickBooks for accounting.
			- You don't own the software, but you pay an access fee to use it or might even be free.
			- That removes any maintenance you might have to do, and you always have the latest features.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669983108657_0.png)
		-
		- #### Serverless
			- It doesn't mean that there are not servers. Of course there are! But Azure manages them for you
			- Azure Functions is an example of PaaS that provides a serverless service
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669983537595_0.png)
			-
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1669983611128_0.png)
		- Azure doesn't really provide a SaaS option.

	- ### Cloud Architecture Models #flashcard
	  id:: 638e1a02-b767-4bd5-ad3e-57b2268e3dd5
		- #### Private Cloud
			- Private means that the servers in the cloud are open to selected users only, instead of the public.
		- #### Public Cloud
			- Anyone with an internet connection can instantly becomea a master of the service.
		- #### Hybrid Cloud
			- It's a mix of the two previous models
			- It could be *the best of both worlds*

	- ### Regions and Availability Zones
		- What is a Region? #flashcard
			- A region is a set of datacenters deployed within a latency-defined perimeter and connected through a dedicated regional low-latency network.
			- Two or more data centers not too far from each other connected with a fiber connection.
			- A set of data centers that are close enough to each other that it doesn't matter which datacenter your data is in. Latency is the time it takes for data to travel.
		- How to choose a region? #flashcard
			- **Location**
				- Choose a region closest to your users to minimize latency
			- **Features**
				- Some features aren't in all regions. If you need a specific feature, some regions might be unavailable.
			- **Price**
				- The price of service vary from region to region. For example, because of the cost of electric power.
		- Each region is {{cloze paired}} with another region (except Brasil South) #flashcard
		- What are availability zones? #flashcard
			- An availability zone is a physical location within a region.
			- Each zone has its own power, cooling and networking
			- Each region has **a minimum of three** zones
			- Within a region and each zone has its own separate power, cooling and networking. Used for protecting data from failures
	- ### Resource Groups & Azure Resource Manager
		- #### Features of Resource Groups #flashcard
			- All resources belong to a resource group.
			- A Resource Group is not a resource.
			- Each resource can only exist in a single resource group
			- You can add or remove resources to any resource group at any time
			- You can move a resource from one resource group to another
			- Resources from multiple regions can be in one resource group
			- You can give users access to a resource group and everything in it.
			- Resources can interact with other resources in different resource groups
			- A resource group has a location, or region, as it stores meta data about the resources in it.
		- #### Features of Azure Resource Manager #flashcard
			- **Group Resource Handling:**
				- You can deploy, manage and monitor resources as a group
			- **Consistency:**
				- Deploying resources from various tools will always result in the same consistent state.
			- **Dependencies:**
				- Define dependencies between resources to make sure they don't get in a fight.
			- **Access Control:**
				- Built-in features in the ARM make it easy to assign access rights to users.
			- **Tagging:**
				- Tag resources to easily identify them for future scenarios. Tagging is a way to label individual resources.
			- **Billing:**
				- Use tagging to stay on top of billing for groups of resources.

	- ### Virtual Machines #flashcard
		- Essentially, it's a computer, or server, that you access exclusively.
		- It's virtual because its hardware is shared by the power of virtualisation.
		- Virtual Machines are an **IaaS** offering, where you are responsible for the entire machine.
		- Priced hourly and type of resource.
		- #### Pros:
			- **Control:** Use virtual machines when you need to control all aspects of an environment or machine.
			- **Application:** Install specific applications on your Linux or Windows machines.
			- **Existing Infrastructure:** You can move existing resources and virtual machines to Azure from on-premises or another cloud provider.
		- #### Cons:
			- **Not for Everything:** If you can use another Azure service instead, it is often worth it.
			- **Maintenance:** A lot of maintenance with VMs. Operating systems updates, patches, security concerns.
	- ### Scale Sets
		- A Scale Set allows you to create a group of {{cloze identical (cloned)}}, load balanced VMs #flashcard
		- #### Benefits: #flashcard
			- **Multiple VMs**: Simple to manage multiple identical VMs using a load balancer
			- **High Availability:** If one VM fails or stops, the others in the *scale set* will keep working.
			- **Auto Scaling:** Automatically match demand by adding or removing VMs from the scale set.
			- **Large Scale:** Run up to 1.000 VMs in a single scale set.
