		- In life design, we reframe a lot. The biggest reframe is that your life can‚Äôt be perfectly planned, that there isn‚Äôt just one solution to your life, and that that‚Äôs a good thing. There are many designs for your life, all filled with hope for the kind of creative and unfolding reality that makes life worth living into. Your life is not a thing, it‚Äôs an experience; the fun comes from designing and enjoying the experience. #flashcard

		- Designers don‚Äôt think their way forward. Designers build their way forward. What does that mean? It means you are not just going to be dreaming up a lot of fun fantasies that have no relationship to the real world‚Äîor the real you. You are going to build things (we call them prototypes), try stuff, and have a lot of fun in the process. #flashcard

			- There is no sitting on the bench just thinking about what you are going to do. There is only getting in the game. Designers try things. They test things out. They create prototype after prototype, failing often, until they find what works and what solves the problem. Sometimes they find the problem is entirely different from what they first thought it was. Designers embrace change.

		- A well-designed life is a life that makes sense. It‚Äôs a life in which who you are, what you believe, and what you do all line up together. When you have a well-designed life and someone asks you, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going?,‚Äù you have an answer. You can tell that person that your life is going well, and you can tell how and why. #flashcard

		  id:: 17915bdd-118f-4992-b7ef-b61165b9d7fe
			- What happens when you do these things? What happens when you engage in life design? Actually, something quite extraordinary happens. Things you want start to show up in your life. You start to hear of job openings you were dreaming about. People you were interested in meeting just happen to be in town. What is happening here? For starters, it‚Äôs that ‚Äúgetting good at being lucky‚Äù thing we mentioned earlier, a result of curiosity and awareness, and a by-product of using the five mind-sets. In addition, the process of discovering who you are and what you want has a rather extraordinary effect on your life. There will be effort and action involved, no doubt, but it will seem, rather surprisingly, as if everyone is conspiring to help you. And, by being aware of the process, you will have a lot of fun along the way.

Somewhere, in some area of your life, you are stuck. You have a wicked problem. And that‚Äôs a wonderful and exciting place to start.

		- These are all gravity problems‚Äîmeaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if it‚Äôs not actionable, it‚Äôs not a problem. Let‚Äôs repeat that. If it‚Äôs not actionable, it‚Äôs not a problem. It‚Äôs a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it‚Äôs not a problem that can be solved. #flashcard

			- When we ask our students, ‚ÄúHow many lifetimes‚Äô worth of living are there in you?,‚Äù the average answer is 3.4. And if you accept this idea‚Äîthat there are multiple great designs for your life, though you‚Äôll still only get to live one‚Äîit is rather liberating. There is no one idea for your life. There are many lives you could live happily and productively (no matter how many years old you are), and there are lots of different paths you could take to live each of those productive, amazingly different lives. So do the math; this adds up to tons of different possible ideas you might have.

			- Nature of the work. Salary and the friendliness of co-workers come in second and third, to complete this completely dysfunctional job-seeker trifecta. The problem with this scenario is that there is no way to know the real ‚Äúnature of the work‚Äù before you have gotten very close to actually getting the job. It‚Äôs impossible. Since so many job descriptions are dysfunctional and inaccurate, most people rule out a job as not being ‚Äúright‚Äù for them

			- You have to convince the person or people in charge of filling that job that you and the job description are the perfect fit (match made in heaven, can‚Äôt live without each other, have to be together or else). Since you don‚Äôt really know much about the nature of the work, you have to fake your enthusiasm to make this process work. In other words, you either lie or you don‚Äôt apply. And nobody likes to lie. But when you are looking for an offer rather than a job‚Äîwhen your goal switches from getting one job to getting as many job offers as possible‚Äîeverything changes. You don‚Äôt have to be deceptive. You can be genuinely curious about the job, because it is absolutely true that you would like the opportunity to evaluate an offer. It‚Äôs not a matter of semantics; it‚Äôs a matter of authenticity. When you reframe the job search into an offer search, you end up being more authentic, energetic, persistent, and playful while you pursue your next position or opportunity. And, ironically, this ends up making you more likely to get the offer. People don‚Äôt hire r√©sum√©s; they hire people. People they like. People who are interesting.
