			- What‚Äôs the reason why the tester shouldn‚Äôt be the same person than the developer? #flashcard
			  id:: 9845db7e-68c2-4424-83a5-ec45a5ef0e8f
				- Some types of testing require specific skills or some distance from the tested software in order to mitigate any bias its creators may be subject to. This is why testing is a separate area of expertise.

			- Who should write the unit tests? #flashcard

				- Nevertheless, unit tests are 100 percent developer-owned.

			- How would you fix a new bug issue in a maintenance project? #flashcard
			  id:: 6bf4eba7-3a91-4c1a-82e5-2198cdee7e76
				- A well-proven technique for fixing bugs is restraining oneself from rushing ahead to implement a fix, and first writing a test that‚Äôll fail because of the bug‚Äôs presence. In the absence of the bug, that test would pass. Once the test is in place, the bug is fixed. If the fix is correct, the test passes.

			- Therefore, this book recurrently returns to the topic of collaboration between team members who are better at writing the code and team members who are better at testing it. #flashcard

	- Chapter 2. Testing Objectives, Styles, and Roles

			- By now it should be obvious that developer testing, as described in this book, is testing meant to support. #flashcard

			- About the Tester role in Agile #flashcard
			  id:: 020fc8f8-e152-4569-831f-c94c0a76b8fd
				- In agile testing, the role of the tester is shifted from reactive to proactive. Instead of writing test cases, waiting for something to test, or executing manual tests, the tester becomes the team‚Äôs quality champion and contributes to a successful release in any way she can. For example, by helping the customer or product owner to specify desired functionality, by making sure that testing activities are taken into account during planning and estimation meetings, by educating and assisting the developers in test design and test automation, or by pair programming or pair testing.

			- What are the differences between Traditional and Agile mind-sets? #flashcard
			  id:: 4a206f33-6fe7-4829-80fb-cc5754da4226
				- The wording is important here. In traditional testing, tests are supposed to be planned and created in parallel with the development. The difference is that collaboration, joint planning, and common success/completion criteria aren‚Äôt emphasized.

			- Just talking seriously about QA and what should be your attitude #flashcard
			  id:: cc824a66-e064-4cdf-b3dc-420d355bc0b8
				- You know what? None of these factors really matter. If you‚Äôre the only developer, or your team doesn‚Äôt have any testers, or you‚Äôre being rushed by others, or the system is old and crappy, your quality assurance process is the only one you have, and it will make or break your software.

	- Chapter 3. The Testing Vocabulary
		- -
			- All developers sometimes make mistakes. These are known as errors in the language of testing. #flashcard

			- Errors lead to defects in the software #flashcard
			  id:: aa502e20-7ea8-4441-adf2-ec231f2f6681
		- -
		- -
			- Defects/bugs may lead to software failures. Not all of them do, though. A defect in code that‚Äôs never executed won‚Äôt cause a failure. #flashcard

			- What are system tests? #flashcard
			  id:: 2b457781-3939-428b-9a09-85d2969df14d
				- Systems are made up of finished and integrated building blocks. They may be components or other systems. System testing is the activity of verifying that the entire system works. System tests are often executed from a black box perspective

			- What are negative tests? #flashcard
			  id:: 5888be78-1562-44eb-af9f-f6df40d7b610
				- The purpose of negative testing is to verify that the system behaves correctly if supplied with invalid values and that it doesn‚Äôt generate any unexpected results. What outcome to expect depends on the test level. At the system level, we generally want the system to ‚Äúdo the right thing‚Äù: either reject the faulty input in a user-friendly manner, or recover somehow. At the unit level, throwing an exception may be the right thing to do. For example, if a function exercised with a unit test expects a positive number and throws an IllegalArgumentException or ArgumentOutOfRangeException in a negative test that may be fine. What‚Äôs important is that the developer has anticipated the scenario.

			- Integration tests verify that components/systems can talk to each other, but sometimes the term is used to describe tests that are somewhere between unit tests and system tests. #flashcard

	- Chapter 4. Testability from a Developer‚Äôs Perspective
		- -
			- However, estimating progress for software that has no tests (because of poor testability) ranges between best guesses and wishful thinking. A developer who believes he is ‚Äú95 percent finished‚Äù with a feature has virtually no way of telling what fraction of seemingly unrelated functionality he has broken along the way and how much time it‚Äôll take to fix these regressions and the remaining ‚Äú5 percent‚Äù. A suite of tests makes this situation more manageable. Again, if the feature is supposedly ‚Äú95 percent finished‚Äù and all tests for the new functionality pass, as well as those that exercise the rest of the system, the estimate is much more credible. Now the uncertainty is reduced to potential surprises in the remaining work, not to random regressions that may pop up anywhere in the system #flashcard

			- Changing software that has no tests makes the average developer uncomfortable and afraid (and it should). Fear is easily observed in code. It manifests itself as duplication‚Äîthe safe way to avoid breaking something that works. #flashcard
