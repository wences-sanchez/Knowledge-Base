	- 1. The Big Picture
		- Devops is a way of thinking and a way of working. It is a framework for sharing stories and developing empathy, enabling people and teams to practice their crafts in effective and lasting ways. It is part of the cultural weave that shapes how we work and why. Many people think about devops as specific tools like Chef or Docker, but tools alone are not devops. What makes tools “devops” is the manner of their use, not fundamental characteristics of the tools themselves.

	- 2. What Is Devops?
		- In a siloed, nondevops environment, the lack of a shared understanding would be like the General trying to start coding without making sure George understands the requirements—it might end up working, but without communication of intentions, the odds are stacked against it.
			- **Note**: What not to do when I have a doubt…
	- 3. A History of Devops
		- In 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission, the lunar module guidance computer software was tasked with too many calculations for its limited capacity. Hamilton’s team had programmed the software such that it could be manually overridden, allowing Neil Armstrong to step in and pilot the lunar module using manual controls.
		  
		  The freedom and trust that the management team afforded the team of engineers working on the onboard flight software, as well as the mutual respect between team members, led to software that facilitated one of humankind’s great leaps in technology as Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon. Without this high-trust environment, this manual override ability (something that turned out to be of critical importance) might not have been present, and the moon landing story might have had a very different outcome.
	- 4. Foundational Terminology and Concepts
		- In waterfall’s heyday, there was a high cost to delivering software on CD-ROMs or floppy disks, not including the cost to customers for manual installation. Fixing a bug required manufacturing and distributing new floppies or CD-ROMs. Because of these costs, it made sense to spend more time and effort specifying requirements up front rather than trying to fix mistakes later.
