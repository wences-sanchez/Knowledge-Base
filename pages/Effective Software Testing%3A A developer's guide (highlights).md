			- Put simply, testing is nothing but executing a piece of software to see if it behaves as expected. But testing is also hard. Its difficulty surfaces when thinking about the full set of test cases to be designed and executed. Out of the infinitely many possible test cases, which one should you write? Did you do enough testing to move the system to production? What extra tests do you need? Why these tests? And, if you need to change the system, how should you set up the test suite so that it supports rather than impedes future change?

			- I have been using two words to describe how I expect a developer to test: *effectively* and *systematically*. Being *effective* means we focus on writing the right tests. Software testing is all about trade-offs. Testers want to maximize the number of bugs they find while minimizing the effort required to find the bugs. How do we achieve this? By knowing what to test.
			  
			  All the techniques I present in this book have a clear beginning (what to test) and a clear end (when to stop). Of course, I do not mean your systems will be bug-free if you follow these techniques. As a community, we still do not know how to build bug-free systems. But I can confidently say that the number of bugs will be reduced, hopefully to tolerable levels.
			  
			  Being *systematic* means that for a given piece of code, any developer should come up with the same test suite. Testing often happens in an ad hoc manner. Developers engineer the test cases that come to mind. It is common to see two developers developing different test suites for the same program. We should be able to systematize our processes to reduce the dependency on the developer who is doing the job.
