			- A scenario is a narrative that describes a situation in which a user is using your product’s features to do something that they want to do. The scenario should briefly explain the user’s problem and present an imagined way that the problem might be solved. There is no need to include everything in the scenario; it isn’t a detailed system specification. #flashcard
