	- How would you count the numbers of files inside a directory in the Linux Terminal? #flashcard
		- In order to count files recursively on Linux, you have to use the “find” command and pipe it with the “wc” command in order to count the number of files.
		  $ find <directory> -type f | wc -l
		  As a reminder, the “find” command is used in order to search for files on your system. 
		  When used with the “-f” option, you are targeting ony files. 
		  By default, the “find” command does not stop at the first depth of the directory : it will explore every single subdirectory, making the file searching recursive.
		  For example, if you want to recursively count files in the “/etc” directory, you would write the following query :
		  $ find /etc -type f | wc -l
