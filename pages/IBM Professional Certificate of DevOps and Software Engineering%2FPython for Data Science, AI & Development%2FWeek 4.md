		- #### Modes of opening a file in Python
			- **r** --> for reading
			- **w** --> for writing
			- **a** --> appending
		-
		- But is recommended to use `with open() as var:`

	- ### Writing Files with Open
		- We can use the `.write()` method to write to a file
		- The option **w** will overwrite the file if it already exists
		- The option **a** will append our contents
		- The option **r+** is for reading and writing. Cannot trucate the file
		- The option **w+** is also for reading and writing. Truncates the pre-existing file content.
		- The option **a+** is for appending and reading. Creates a new file if not exists.
		-
	- To work with a file on existing data, use **r+** and **a+**.
		- If using **r+** (read and write), it's a good idea to call the `.truncate()` method to not use more space than needed.
		- This will reduce the file to your data and delete everything that follows (if not using `.truncate()` after a `.write()` followed by `.read()`).
	- It's important to use `file.truncate()` when dealing with files in Python in read and write `r+`
