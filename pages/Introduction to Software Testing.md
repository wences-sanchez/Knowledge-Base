- ## Week 1
	- ### Lesson 1: Introduction to Testing
		- **Verification** VS **Validation** #spaced
			- **Validation** is when we make sure that the actual product against the expected result from the user's perspective. It's a dynamic testing. It answers the question:
				- > Are we building the right product?
			- **Verification** is when we check that the software is free from bugs, technically speaking. Upon our internal requirements. It answers the question:
				- > Are we building the product right?
		- According to **Turing's halting problem**, it is theoretically not possible at all to check a perfect verification of one program by having another one checking it. #Curiosities

	- ### Lesson 2: Why and How we Test
		- Types of tests: #spaced
			- **Unit tests:** testing individual classes / functions
			- **Integration tests:** testing packages / subsystems
			- **System tests:** testing the entire system
		- Even with **TDD**, there is *re-test* when you modify your code.
		- The function f(x) of a program is not continuous, so we can't derive its output (unlike other engineering fields) to test it. #Curiosities
