	- Although Java is otherwise completely object-oriented, the primitive types are not. They are analogous to the simple types found in most other non–object-oriented languages. The reason for this is efficiency. #space

	- Java defines four integer types: byte, short, int, and long. All of these are signed, positive and negative values. #space
		- ([Location 2536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2536))

	- Java does not support unsigned, positive-only integers. #space

	- The smallest integer type is byte. This is a signed 8-bit type that has a range from –128 to 127. #space
		- ([Location 2546](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2546))
	- -
	- -
	- The most commonly used integer type is int. It is a signed 32-bit type that has a range from –2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. #space
		- ([Location 2554](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2554))
	- -
	- -
	- Although you might think that using a byte or short would be more efficient than using an int in situations in which the larger range of an int is not needed, this may not be the case. The reason is that when byte and short values are used in an expression, they are promoted to int when the expression is evaluated. #space
		- ([Location 2556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2556))
	- -
	- -
	- long is a signed 64-bit type and is useful for those occasions where an int type is not large enough #space

	- Floating-point numbers, also known as real numbers, #space

	- -
	- -
	- Variables of type float are useful when you need a fractional component, but don’t require a large degree of precision. For example, float can be useful when representing dollars and cents. #space

	- However, to specify a long literal, you will need to explicitly tell the compiler that the literal value is of type long. You do this by appending an upper- or lowercase L to the literal. For example, 0x7ffffffffffffffL or 9223372036854775807L #space
		- ([Location 2636](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2636))

	- in some other languages strings are implemented as arrays of characters. However, this is not the case in Java. Strings are actually object types. #space

	- It is not uncommon to think in terms of two general categories of scopes: global and local. However, these traditional scopes do not fit well with Java’s strict, object-oriented model. While it is possible to create what amounts to being a global scope, it is by far the exception, not the rule. In Java, the two major scopes are those defined by a class and those defined by a method. #space

	- -
	- the following fragment casts an int to a byte. If the integer’s value is larger than the range of a byte, it will be reduced modulo (the remainder of an integer division by the) byte’s range. #space
		- ([Location 2778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2778))
	- -
	- -
	- Thus, when a floating-point value is assigned to an integer type, the fractional component is lost. For example, if the value 1.23 is assigned to an integer, the resulting value will simply be 1. The 0.23 will have been truncated. Of course, if the size of the whole number component is too large to fit into the target integer type, then that value will be reduced modulo the target type’s range. #space
		- ([Location 2782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2782))
	- -
	- -
	- Java defines several type promotion rules that apply to expressions. They are as follows: First, all byte, short, and char values are promoted to int, as just described. Then, if one operand is a long, the whole expression is promoted to long. If one operand is a float, the entire expression is promoted to float. If any of the operands are double, the result is double. #space

	- Recently, an exciting new feature called local variable type inference was added to the Java language. #space
		- ([Location 2911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2911))
	- -
	- -
	- Beginning with JDK 10, it is now possible to let the compiler infer the type of a local variable based on the type of its initializer, thus avoiding the need to explicitly specify the type. #space
		- ([Location 2917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=2917))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]

	- In both cases, avg will be of type double. In the first case, its type is explicitly specified. In the second, its type is inferred as double because the initializer 10.0 is of type double. #space

	- If you use the || and && forms, rather than the | and & forms of these operators, Java will not bother to evaluate the right-hand operand #space

	- There is one important point to understand about the for-each style loop. Its iteration variable is “read-only” as it relates to the underlying array. An assignment to the iteration variable has no effect on the underlying array. In other words, you can’t change the contents of the array by assigning the iteration variable a new value. #space

	- Because an object is an instance of a class, you will often see the two words object and instance used interchangeably. #space

	- REMEMBER When you assign one object reference variable to another object reference variable, you are not creating a copy of the object, you are only making a copy of the reference. #space

	- A parameter is a variable defined by a method that receives a value when the method is called. For example, in square( ), i is a parameter. An argument is a value that is passed to a method when it is invoked. For example, square(100) passes 100 as an argument. Inside square( ), the parameter i receives that value. #space

	- -
	- garbage collection. It works like this: when no references to an object exist, that object is assumed to be no longer needed, and the memory occupied by the object can be reclaimed. There is no need to explicitly destroy objects. #space
		- ([Location 3951](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07KSQ9RKF&location=3951))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- -
	- -
	- Garbage collection only occurs sporadically (if at all) during the execution of your program. It will not occur simply because one or more objects exist that are no longer used. #space

		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- -
	- -
	- REMEMBER When an object reference is passed to a method, the reference itself is passed by use of call-by-value. However, since the value being passed refers to an object, the copy of that value will still refer to the same object that its corresponding argument does. #space

	- If you need to do computation in order to initialize your static variables, you can declare a static block that gets executed exactly once, when the class is first loaded. The following example shows a class that has a static method, some static variables, and a static initialization block: #space

	- In addition to fields, both method parameters and local variables can be declared final. Declaring a parameter final prevents it from being changed within the method. Declaring a local variable final prevents it from being assigned a value more than once. #space

	- Dynamic, run-time polymorphism is one of the most powerful mechanisms that object-oriented design brings to bear on code reuse and robustness. The ability of existing code libraries to call methods on instances of new classes without recompiling while maintaining a clean abstract interface is a profoundly powerful tool. #space
