		- The *loop* is divided into two groups with the first group representing the **development** stages of the cycle, and the second group representing the **operational** stages.
		- In the **development** group we start with the stage labeled **plan** and then move on to **code**, **build** and **test**.
		- In the **operations** group we continue the cycle with **release**, **deploy**, **operate** and **monitor**.
		- **Jenkins** is the perfect tool for automating processes, tied to the build, test, release and deploy stages.
		- When tools like Jenkins are used to automate the build and test stages, the process is known as continuous integration.
