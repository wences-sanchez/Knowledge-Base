	- Mention the floating-point types in Java and its sizes .java #flashcard
		- Floating-point types represent numbers with fractional parts. Java has two such types: double (64 bits) and float (32 bits). These types can store only a limited number of significant decimal digits (~6-7 for float and ~14-16 for double). Usually, you will use the double type in practice.
