	- The idea is simple: a configuration file specifies which base virtual machine we need to use from a set of available ones online and how you would like to customize it—that is, which commands you will want to run the first time you start the machine—this is called "provisioning". #spaced
		- ([Location 385](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=385))
	- You will probably get the Vagrant configuration from a public repository, and if this configuration ever changes, you can get the changes and reprovision your machine. It's easy, right? #spaced
		- ([Location 387](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=387))
	- $ vagrant up The first time you execute it, it will take some time as it will have to download the image from the repository, and then it will execute the provisioner.sh file. #spaced
		- ([Location 420](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=420))
	- HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. As any other protocol, the goal is to allow two entities or nodes to communicate with each other. #spaced
		- ([Location 578](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=578))
		- #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- HTTP is stateless; that is, it treats each request independently, unrelated to any previous one. This means that with this request and response sequence, the communication is finished. Any new requests will not be aware of this specific interchange of messages. #spaced
		- ([Location 588](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=588))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- The URL of the message is the destination of the message. The request will contain the receiver's URL, and the response will contain the sender's. #spaced
		- ([Location 592](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=592))
		- #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- http://myserver.com/greeting?name=Alex. #spaced
		- ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=595))
		- #[[orange]] #[[naranja]]
	- The HTTP method is the verb of the message. #spaced
		- ([Location 599](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=599))
		- #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- GET: This asks the receiver about something, and the receiver usually sends this information back. The most common example is asking for a web page, where the receiver will respond with the HTML code of the requested page. #spaced
		- ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=600))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- POST: This means that the sender wants to perform an action that will update the data that the receiver is holding. For example, the sender can ask the receiver to update his profile name. #spaced
		- ([Location 602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=602))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- The body part is usually present in response messages even though a request message can contain it too. #spaced
		- ([Location 607](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=607))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- The headers on an HTTP message are the metadata that the receiver needs in order to understand the content of the message. #spaced
		- ([Location 613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=613))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- The status code is present in responses. #spaced
		- ([Location 619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=619))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- Common status codes are: #spaced
		- ([Location 622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=622))
	- Representing the parameters as part of the body is a common way to send information when submitting a form, but not the only one. You can add a query string to the URL, add JSON to the body of the message, and so on. #spaced
		- ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=633))
	- rather all of them in a generic way. The main reason for this choice of terminology is to try to separate HTTP from web applications. You will see at the end of the book that HTTP is used for more than just websites. #spaced
		- ([Location 639](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=639))
	- A web page is a single document with content. It contains links that open other web pages with different content. #spaced
		- ([Location 642](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=642))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- A website is the set of web pages that usually live in the same server and are related to each other. #spaced
		- ([Location 644](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=644))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- A web application is just a piece of software that runs on a client, which is usually a browser, and communicates with a server. #spaced
		- ([Location 645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=645))
		- #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- A server is a remote machine that receives requests from a client, processes them, and generates a response. This response will go back to the client, generally rendered by the browser in order to display it to the user. #spaced
		- ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=646))
		- #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- So, what is the difference between a website and a web application? Well, the web application can be a small part of a bigger website with a specific functionality. #spaced
		- ([Location 650](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=650))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- Also, not all websites are web applications as a web application always does something but a website can just display information. #spaced
		- ([Location 651](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=651))

	- Different ways of including JS You might notice that we included the CSS file reference at the end of the <head> section and JS at the end of <body>. You can actually include JS in both the <head> and the <body>; just bear in mind that the script will be executed as soon as it is included. If your script references fields that are not yet defined or other JS files that will be included later, JS will fail. #spaced
		- ([Location 684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=684))
	- Recibiendo solicitudes por el protocolo HTTP #flashcard
		- A web server is no more than a piece of software running on a machine and listening to requests from a specific port.
		- ([Location 692](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=692))
		- #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- The web server decides which web application—usually a file in the filesystem—needs to process the request. In order to decide, the web server usually considers the path of the URL; #spaced
		- ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=702))
	- There are powerful web servers that support high loads of traffic, such as Apache or Nginx, #spaced
		- ([Location 709](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=709))
		- #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- El servidor web (en este caso el embebido) busca el fichero index.php primero #flashcard
		- $ php -S localhost:8000

		- #[[orange]] #[[naranja]]
	- If you do not change the default options, PHP will always try to find an index.php file in the directory in which you started the web server. If this is not found, PHP will try to find an index.html file. #spaced
		- ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=738))
	- you have to start the file with <?php. There are other options, and you can also finish the file with ?>, #spaced
		- ([Location 768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=768))
		- #[[pink]] #[[rosa]]
	- <?php   echo 'hello world'; ?> bye world #spaced
		- ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=771))
		- #[[orange]] #[[naranja]]
	- you will see that it prints both messages, hello world and bye world. The reason why this happens is simple: you already know that the PHP code there prints the hello world message. What happens next is that anything outside the PHP tags will be interpreted as is. If there is an HTML code for instance, it would not be printed as is, but will be interpreted by the browser. #spaced
		- ([Location 772](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=772))
	- include: This will try to find and include the specified file each time it is invoked. If the file is not found, PHP will throw a warning, but will continue with the execution. #spaced
		- ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=778))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- require: This will do the same as include, but PHP will throw an error instead of a warning if the file is not found. #spaced
		- ([Location 780](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=780))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- include_once: This function will do what include does, but it will include the file only the first time that it is invoked. Subsequent calls will be ignored. #spaced
		- ([Location 781](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=781))
		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- require_once: This works the same as require, but it will include the file only the first time that it is invoked. Subsequent calls will be ignored. #spaced
		- ([Location 782](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=782))

	- Each function has its own usage, so it is not right to say that one is better than the other. #spaced
		- ([Location 784](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=784))
	- Moreover, as it is some HTML code, we might want to include it multiple times, so we did not choose the require_once option. #spaced

	- PHP variables start with the $ sign followed by the variable name. A valid variable name starts with a letter or an underscore followed by any combination of letters, numbers, and/or underscores. It is case sensitive. #spaced

	- PHP has eight primitive types, but for now, we will focus on its four scalar types: #spaced

	- Exponentiation (**) raises the first operand to the power of the second. #spaced

	- The == (equals) operator evaluates two expressions after type juggling, that is, it will try to transform both expressions to the same type, and then compare them. Instead, the === (identical) operator evaluates two expressions without type juggling, so even if they look the same, if they are not of the same type, the comparison will return false. The same applies to != or <> (not equal to) and !== (not identical): #spaced

		- ([Location 1050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=1050))
	- The isset function takes an array position, and returns true or false depending on whether that position exists or not: #spaced

		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- array_search. This function works in the same way except that instead of returning a Boolean, it returns the key where the value is found, or false otherwise. #spaced

		- #[[blue]] #[[azul]]
	- An a in the name means associative, and thus, will preserve the key-value association. An r in the name means reverse, so the order will be from high to low. A k means key, so the sorting will be based on the keys instead of the values. #spaced

	- When printing something with echo, PHP tries to transform everything it gets into strings. Since the string version of the Boolean false is an empty string, that would not be useful for our application.
