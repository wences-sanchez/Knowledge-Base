	- The idea is simple: a configuration file specifies which base virtual machine we need to use from a set of available ones online and how you would like to customize it—that is, which commands you will want to run the first time you start the machine—this is called "provisioning". #ñspace

	- You will probably get the Vagrant configuration from a public repository, and if this configuration ever changes, you can get the changes and reprovision your machine. It's easy, right? #ñspace

	- -
	- $ vagrant up The first time you execute it, it will take some time as it will have to download the image from the repository, and then it will execute the provisioner.sh file. #ñspace

	- HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. As any other protocol, the goal is to allow two entities or nodes to communicate with each other. #ñspace

	- HTTP is stateless; that is, it treats each request independently, unrelated to any previous one. This means that with this request and response sequence, the communication is finished. Any new requests will not be aware of this specific interchange of messages. #ñspace

	- The URL of the message is the destination of the message. The request will contain the receiver's URL, and the response will contain the sender's. #ñspace

	- GET: This asks the receiver about something, and the receiver usually sends this information back. The most common example is asking for a web page, where the receiver will respond with the HTML code of the requested page. #ñspace

	- POST: This means that the sender wants to perform an action that will update the data that the receiver is holding. For example, the sender can ask the receiver to update his profile name. #ñspace

	- Representing the parameters as part of the body is a common way to send information when submitting a form, but not the only one. You can add a query string to the URL, add JSON to the body of the message, and so on. #ñspace

	- rather all of them in a generic way. The main reason for this choice of terminology is to try to separate HTTP from web applications. You will see at the end of the book that HTTP is used for more than just websites. #ñspace

	- A web page is a single document with content. It contains links that open other web pages with different content. #ñspace

	- A web application is just a piece of software that runs on a client, which is usually a browser, and communicates with a server. #ñspace

	- A server is a remote machine that receives requests from a client, processes them, and generates a response. This response will go back to the client, generally rendered by the browser in order to display it to the user. #ñspace

	- So, what is the difference between a website and a web application? Well, the web application can be a small part of a bigger website with a specific functionality. #ñspace

	- Different ways of including JS You might notice that we included the CSS file reference at the end of the <head> section and JS at the end of <body>. You can actually include JS in both the <head> and the <body>; just bear in mind that the script will be executed as soon as it is included. If your script references fields that are not yet defined or other JS files that will be included later, JS will fail. #ñspace

		- A web server is no more than a piece of software running on a machine and listening to requests from a specific port.

	- The web server decides which web application—usually a file in the filesystem—needs to process the request. In order to decide, the web server usually considers the path of the URL; #ñspace

	- If you do not change the default options, PHP will always try to find an index.php file in the directory in which you started the web server. If this is not found, PHP will try to find an index.html file. #ñspace
		- ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01ALMQ550&location=738))

		- #[[orange]] #[[naranja]]
	- -
	- -
	- you will see that it prints both messages, hello world and bye world. The reason why this happens is simple: you already know that the PHP code there prints the hello world message. What happens next is that anything outside the PHP tags will be interpreted as is. If there is an HTML code for instance, it would not be printed as is, but will be interpreted by the browser. #ñspace

	- The == (equals) operator evaluates two expressions after type juggling, that is, it will try to transform both expressions to the same type, and then compare them. Instead, the === (identical) operator evaluates two expressions without type juggling, so even if they look the same, if they are not of the same type, the comparison will return false. The same applies to != or <> (not equal to) and !== (not identical): #ñspace
