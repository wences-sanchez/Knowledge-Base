		- Testing is done to find information. Critical decisions about the project or the product are made on the basis of that information. #flashcard

		- Test things that are changed before things that are the same. Fixes and updates mean fresh risk. ■ Test core functions before contributing functions. Test the critical and the popular things that the product does. Test the functions that make the product what it is. ■ Test capability before reliability. Test whether each function can work at all before going deep into the examination of how any one function performs under many different conditions. #flashcard

		- The difference between excellent testing and mediocre testing is how you think: your test design choices, your ability to interpret what you observe, and your ability to tell a compelling story about it. #flashcard

		- To do black box testing well, learn about the user, her expectations and needs, the technology, the configurations the software will run on, the other software that this software will interact with, the data the software must manage, the development process, and so on. The advantage of black box testing is that you probably think differently than the programmer, and, thus, are likely to anticipate risks that the programmer missed. #flashcard
