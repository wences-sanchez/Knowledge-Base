- ## Lesson 9: [[User and Group Management]]
	- ### 9.2 Understanding the Role of Ownership #spaced
		- When a user creates a file on Linux, that user becomes the file owner.
		- Every Linux user is a member of at least one group, and while creating a file on Linux, that group will become group owner.
		- Because of group ownership, every user must be a member of at least one group.

			- For creating the home directory
		- `$sudo groupadd sales`
		- `$ sudo usermod -aG sales bill`

- ## Lesson 11: Storage Management Essentials
	- ### 11.1 Understanding Linux Storage Solutions #spaced
		- Linux works with partitions. It doesn't take the whole hard disk.

		- To address disks, Linux provides devices files in **/dev**
			- **/dev/sda** -> First SCSI hard disk
			- **/dev/sdb** -> Second SCSI hard disk
			- **/dev/vda** -> KVM hard disk
			- **/dev/nvme0n1** -> First NVME hard disk
			- **/dev/sr0** -> Optical drive
	- ### Creating MBR Partitions
		- Master Boot Record (MBR) is the old solution for addresssing disks
		- In MBR, a maximum of 4 pa
