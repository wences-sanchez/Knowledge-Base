		- The present is the frailest of improbable constructs. It could have been different. Any part of it, or all of it, could be otherwise. True of the smallest and largest concerns. How easy to conjure worlds in which my toenail had not turned against me; in which I was rich, living north of the Thames after one of my schemes had succeeded; in which Shakespeare had died in childhood and no one missed him, #flashcard

The morning I collected her, the weather was beginning to turn and a cool strong wind was blowing from the east.

What she had wanted and found was open space and a big sky. #flashcard
