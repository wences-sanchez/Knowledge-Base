	- Eternal (and real) ideas to run away. #card
		- With the inheritance, I could have bought a place somewhere north of the river, Notting Hill, or Chelsea. She might even have joined me. She would’ve had space for all the books that were boxed up in her father’s garage in Salisbury.

	- Ways to live #card
		- I paid my rent, which was low in those days, ate and dressed well enough, and thought I was beginning to stabilise, learning to know myself.

	- Regrets... #card

	- What is a robot thinking about? #card
		- ‘It’s the way I’m made. I’m bound to conclude that I’ve a very powerful sense of self and I’m certain that it’s real and that neuroscience will describe it fully one day.

The morning I collected her, the weather was beginning to turn and a cool strong wind was blowing from the east. We drove to Manningtree, parked in a lay-by and set out on the raised footpath that follows the tidal River Stour to the sea. The weather hardly mattered. What she had wanted and found was open space and a big sky. #ñspace
