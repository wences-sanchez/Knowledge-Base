	- Chapter 1: Welcome to Networking

		- What is a network, for dummies? #flashcard
			- A network is nothing more than two or more computers connected by a cable or by a wireless radio connection so that they can exchange information.

		- What is a network interface, for dummies? #flashcard
			- You can create a simple computer network by hooking together all the computers in your office with cables and using the computer’s network interface (an electronic circuit that resides inside your computer and has a special jack on the computer’s backside). Then you tweak a few simple settings in the computer’s operating system (OS) software, and — voilà!

		- How is a network cable different from a telephone cable? #flashcard
			- The type of network cable most commonly used is twisted-pair cable, so named because it consists of several pairs of wires twisted together in a certain way. Twisted-pair cable superficially resembles telephone cable. However, appearances can be deceiving. Most phone systems are wired using a lower grade of cable that doesn’t work for networks.

		- What does packet mean in a network, for dummies? #flashcard
			- A packet is a message that’s sent over the network from one node to another node. The packet includes the address of the node that sent the packet, the address of the node the packet is being sent to, and data.

		- Who did computers work in a bus network? #flashcard
			- In a bus topology, every node on the network can see every packet that’s sent on the cable. Each node looks at each packet to determine whether the packet is intended for it. If so, the node claims the packet. If not, the node ignores the packet. This way, each computer can respond to data sent to it and ignore data sent to other computers on the network.

		- What is a network protocol, for dummies? #flashcard
			- A protocol provides a precise sequence of steps that each element of a network must follow to enable communications. Protocols also define the precise format of all data that is exchanged in a network. For example, the Internet Protocol (IP) defines the format of IP addresses: four eight-bit numbers called octets whose decimal values range from 0 to 255, as in 10.0.101.155.

		- What is a network standard, for dummies? #flashcard
			- A standard is a detailed definition of a protocol that has been established by a standards organization and that vendors follow when they create products. Without standards, it would be impossible for one vendor’s products to work with another vendor’s.

		- What is a network interface, for dummies? #flashcard
			- A network interface is the electronic circuitry that allows a device to connect to a network. Each network interface provides a port, which is the plug-in point for the interface. Generally speaking, the terms port and interface are synonymous.
		- -
		- -
		- What does a MAC stand for? #flashcard
			- Every network interface must have a unique identifier called a MAC address. (MAC stands for media access control, but that won’t be on the test.) Each MAC address is unique throughout the entire world.
		- -
		- -
		- What is DHCP used for? #flashcard
			- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which allows computers that join a network to be assigned an IP address. When a network interface is first connected to a network, it sends out a broadcast message requesting the address of the network’s DHCP server. Every device on the network sees this packet. But only the DHCP service will respond.

		- However, mesh networks are common for metropolitan or wide area networks. These networks use routers to route packets from network to network. For reliability and performance reasons, routers are usually arranged in a way that provides multiple paths between any two nodes on the network in a mesh-like arrangement. #spaced
