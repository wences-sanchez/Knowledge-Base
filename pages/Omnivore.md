		- > In quantum mechanics, particles can sometimes exist as waves and sometimes exist as particles. This can be most famously seen in the double-slit experiment, where particles such as electrons are shot at a board with two slits cut into it, behind which sits a screen that lights up when an electron hits it. If the electrons were particles, they would create two bright lines where they had impacted the screen after passing through one or the other of the slits, according to a popular article in Nature [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-quantum-mechanics-1853f27d901#b49174cb-c7c0-4121-b776-9f57c345e986)

		- > It started at the turn of the 20th century, around the same time Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity, a separate revolution in physics that describes the motion of things at high speeds.

		- > Quantum mechanics is a subfield of physics that describes the behavior of particles ‚Äî atoms, electrons, photons and almost everything in the molecular and submolecular realm.  [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-quantum-mechanics-1853f27d901#8277c8ac-c9cc-4857-bedc-a10418f20185)
			- In fact, quantum mechanics covers the very little, besides affects everything -- since everything is composed by its little pieces.
