Cloud9 is an example of [[PaaS]]
### Leveraging the AWS Global Infrastructure
- #### Regions
	- A [[region]] is a physical location in the world that contains AZs
	- Each [[region]] is **independent** and **isolated** from each other.
	- You can see that you previously have to select a region before doing any activity in AWS.
- #### Availability Zones
	- The AZs are physically separated but connected through low-latency links
	- AZs Allow for high availability
	- If you distribute your application between AZs, you'll have HA.
- #### Edge Locations
	- Edge locations reduce latency. They are used by **AWS CloudFront**

- Regions > Availability Zones > Datacenters #flashcard
	- There are more **Edge Locations** than **Regions** and **AZs**.

- ### Exploring your AWS Account
	- The regions are isolated.
		- That is why you cannot see the contents of a region in others' one.
