		- EC2 is a foundational service used for managing our virtual instances.     - 1. You're able to provision an EC2 instance at the click of a button       2. You can preconfigure it with an AMI template       3. You can deploy applications there       4. You have 750 hours/month in the free tier plan You can use them to deploy a database or a web application #flashcard
			- Mention some characteristics of EC2
	- -
	- -
		- #### On-Demand              - A fixed price in which you are billed down to the second based on the instance type. No contract.              - Use it when:                  - You care about low cost without any upfront payment or long-term commitment.                  - Applications with unpredictable workloads that can't be interrupted                  - Your applications are under development                  - Your workloads will not run longer than a year          - #### Spot              - Your request of instances is fulfilled only if capacity is available.              - Use it when:                  - You are not concerned about the start and stop of your application                  - Your workloads can be interrupted          - #### Reserved Instances              - RIs allow you to commit to a specific instance type in a particular region for 1 or 3 years.          - #### Dedicated Hosts              - Allow you to pay for a physical server that is fully dedicated to running your instances.              - Use it when:                  - You want to bring your own server-bound software license from other vendors.              - Don't confuse it with reserved instances          - #### Savings Plans      - An ELB distributes the traffic across multiple EC2 instances. Whereas the EC2 Auto Scaling feature adds or replaces EC2 instances (it scales them out).          -      - Scale out means to add or remove instances, whereas scale up means to upgrade an instance by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing server. #flashcard
			- #### EC2 Pricing Options
	- -
	- -
		- Serverless simply means that Amazon manages the servers for you and you cannot access them. You can pretend they don't exist. #flashcard
			- What does Serverless mean?
	- -
	- -
		- Compute time: Pay only for compute time used. There is no charge if your code is not running          - Request count: A request is counted each time it starts execution (including tests in the console).          - Always free: Even after the free-usage tier expires, you'll have access to 1 million free Lambda calls each month. #flashcard
			- Describe the pricing model of Lambdas
	- -
	- -
		- Objects are stored in buckets                  - Objects = files                  - Buckets = directories              - Essentially unlimited storage that can hold millions of objects per bucket              - Objects can be public or private              - You can upload objects via the console, the CLI or with the SDKs. #flashcard
			- How is S3 structured?
	- -
	- -
		- You can set security at the bucket level or individual object level using ACLs, bucket policies or access point policies.              - You can enable versioning to create multiple version of your file in order to protect against accidental deletion and to use a previous version.              - You can use S3 access logs to track the access to your buckets and objects.              - S3 is a regional service, but bucket names need to be globally unique. #flashcard
			- How can you set security in S3 and manage its historical data?
	- -
	- -
		- Durability answers the question: Will my data be there tomorrow?              - Availability answers the question: How quickly can I access my data? Can I have it right now?              - This is achievable becasue data stored on a S3 bucket inside a region is replicate acoss multiple servers #flashcard
			- What do durability and availability mean?

		- #### The bigger picture                  - We need content delivery because there are so many requests for almost everything and the idea of a near server which could bring us those contents is awesome!                  - A CDN is a mechanism to deliver content quickly and efficiently based on geographic location              - #### Amazon CloudFront                  - CloudFront makes content available globally or restricts it based on location                  - Speeds up delivery of static and dynamic web content                  - Uses edge locations to cache content                  -                   - #### Use Cases                      - S3 static websites                      - Prevent attacks (like DDoS)                      - IP address blocking (prevent users in certain countries from accessing content) #flashcard
