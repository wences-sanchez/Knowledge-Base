		- The [DefinitelyTyped GitHub repository](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) maintains the TypeScript type definitions for use directly in Node.js and other JavaScript projects, so you don’t have to define these types from scratch. To add these types or the declaration files related to a particular library or a module, you have to look for the packages that start with the `@types` namespace.
		  
		  Open the terminal window and install the packages described above with the following command:
		  
		  npm i -D typescript @types/express @types/node
		  
		  The `-D` flag, also known as the `--dev` flag, is a specification for the package manager to install these libraries as `devDependencies`. #flashcard
