					- Let’s start broad: programs are files that contain a bunch of text written by you, the programmer. That text is parsed by a special program called a *compiler*, which transforms it into an *abstract syntax tree (AST)*, a data structure that ignores things like whitespace, comments, and where you stand on the tabs versus spaces debate. The compiler then converts that AST to a lower-level representation called *bytecode*. You can feed that bytecode into another program called a *runtime* to evaluate it and get a result. So when you run a program, what you’re really doing is telling the runtime to evaluate the bytecode generated by the compiler from the AST parsed from your source code. The details vary, but for most languages this is an accurate high-level view.
					  
					  Once again, the steps are:
					  
					  1.  Program is parsed into an AST.
					    
					  2.  AST is compiled to bytecode.
					    
					  3.  Bytecode is evaluated by the runtime.
					    
					  
					  Where TypeScript is special is that instead of compiling straight to bytecode, TypeScript compiles to… JavaScript code! You then run that JavaScript code like you normally would—in your browser, or with NodeJS, or by hand with a paper and pen (for anyone reading this after the machine uprising has begun).
					  
					  At this point you may be thinking: “Wait! In the last chapter you said TypeScript makes my code safer! When does that happen?”
					  
					  Great question. I actually skipped over a crucial step: after the TypeScript Compiler generates an AST for your program—but before it emits code—it *typechecks* your code.

				  Steps 1–3 are done by TSC, and steps 4–6 are done by the JavaScript runtime that lives in your browser, NodeJS, or whatever JavaScript engine you’re using. #flashcard

				- In this process, steps 1–2 use your program’s types; step 3 does not. That’s worth reiterating: *when TSC compiles your code from TypeScript to JavaScript, it won’t look at your types*. That means your program’s types will never affect your program’s generated output, and are only used for typechecking. This feature makes it foolproof to play around with, update, and improve your program’s types, without risking breaking your application. #flashcard

				- About types in TypeScript #flashcard
				  id:: 63dc0fd6-5ceb-4f7e-9832-bbf817fb16ac
					- To explicitly signal to TypeScript what your types are, use annotations. Annotations take the form *value: type* and tell the typechecker, “Hey! You see this *value* here? Its type is *type*.” Let’s look at a few examples (the comments following each line are the actual types inferred by TypeScript):
					  
					    let
					  
					  And if you want TypeScript to infer your types for you, just leave them off and let TypeScript get to work:
					  
					    let
					  
					  Right away, you’ll notice how good TypeScript is at inferring types for you. If you leave off the annotations, the types are the same! Throughout this book, we will use annotations only when necessary, and let TypeScript work its inference magic for us whenever possible.

				- Dynamic type binding means that JavaScript needs to actually run your program to know the types of things in it. JavaScript doesn’t know your types before running your program.
				  id:: 63dc0fd6-7690-4df3-a46e-d5d5ed2d7622
				  
				  TypeScript is a *gradually typed* language. That means that TypeScript works best when it knows the types of everything in your program at compile time, but it doesn’t have to know every type in order to compile your program. Even in an untyped program TypeScript can infer some types for you and catch some mistakes, but without knowing the types for everything, it will let a lot of mistakes slip through to your users.
				  
				  This gradual typing is really useful for migrating legacy codebases from untyped JavaScript to typed TypeScript (more on that in [“Gradually Migrating from JavaScript to TypeScript”](#migrating-to-typescript)), but unless you’re in the middle of migrating your codebase, you should aim for 100% type coverage. #flashcard

			- bigint
			  id:: 63dc0fd6-d7d3-456d-9f04-1e2b82a178f2
			  
			  `bigint` is a newcomer to JavaScript and TypeScript: it lets you work with large integers without running into rounding errors. While the `number` type can only represent whole numbers up to 253, `bigint` can represent integers bigger than that too. The `bigint` type is the set of all BigInts, and supports things like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (*), division (`/`), and comparison (`<`). Use it like this:
			  
			    let
			  
			  Like with `boolean` and `number`, there are four ways to declare bigints. Try to let TypeScript infer your bigint’s type when you can.
			  
			  Warning
			  
			  At the time of writing, `bigint` is not yet natively supported by every JavaScript engine. If your application relies on `bigint`, be careful to check whether or not it’s supported by your target platform. #flashcard

		- symbol
		  id:: 63dc0fd6-42eb-44d4-af7f-3b23734dd11a
		  
		  `symbol` is a relatively new language feature that arrived with one of the latest major JavaScript revisions (ES2015). Symbols don’t come up often in practice; they are used as an alternative to string keys in objects and maps, in places where you want to be extra sure that people are using the right well-known key and didn’t accidentally set the key—think setting a default iterator for your object (`Symbol.iterator`), or overriding at runtime whether or not your object is an instance of something (`Symbol.hasInstance`). Symbols have the type `symbol`, and there isn’t all that much you can do with them:

		- About duck typing #flashcard
		  id:: 63dc0fd6-74b2-4e1c-8250-79afa790d41a
			- JavaScript is generally *structurally typed*, so TypeScript favors that style of programming over a *nominally typed* style.
			  
			  Structural typing
			  
			  A style of programming where you just care that an object has certain properties, and not what its name is (nominal typing). Also called *duck typing* in some languages (or, not judging a book by its cover).

		- Example of a class in Typescript #flashcard
		  id:: 63dc0fd6-ce10-4d6f-98fc-ef316e5bac98
			- let
			  
			  `{firstName: string, lastName: string}` describes the *shape* of an object, and both the object literal and the class instance from the last example satisfy that shape, so TypeScript lets us assign a `Person` to `c`.

		- What `[key: T] : U` means in TypeScript? #flashcard
		  id:: 63dc0fd6-d121-4f1e-851f-3613e7e14e55
			- Index Signatures
			  
			  The `[key: T]: U` syntax is called an *index signature*, and this is the way you tell TypeScript that the given object might contain more keys. The way to read it is, “For this object, all keys of type `T` must have values of type `U`.” Index signatures let you safely add more keys to an object, in addition to any keys that you explicitly declared.
			  
			  There is one rule to keep in mind for index signatures: the index signature key’s type (`T`) must be assignable to either `number` or `string`

		- How do you declare objects in TypeScript? #flashcard
		  id:: 63dc0fd6-3f49-457f-9509-af46584c6be3
			- To summarize, there are four ways to declare objects in TypeScript:
			  
			  1.  Object literal notation (like `{a: string}`), also called a *shape*. Use this when you know which fields your object could have, or when all of your object’s values will have the same type.
			    
			  2.  Empty object literal notation (`{}`). Try to avoid this.
			    
			  3.  The `object` type. Use this when you just want an object, and don’t care about which fields it has.
			    
			  4.  The `Object` type. Try to avoid this.
			    
			  
			  In your TypeScript programs, you should almost always stick to the first way and the third way. Be careful to avoid the second and fourth ways—use a linter to warn about them, complain about them in code reviews, print posters—use your team’s preferred tool to keep them far away from your codebase.

		- Explain the type aliases in Typescript #flashcard
		  id:: 63dc0fd6-9eed-4afa-80aa-9c97321529d1
			- Type aliases
			  
			  Just like you can use variable declarations (`let`, `const`, and `var`) to declare a variable that aliases a value, you can declare a type alias that points to a type. It looks like this:
			  
			    type
			  
			  `Age` is but a `number`. It can also help make the definition of the `Person` shape easier to understand.

		- About tuples in Typescript #flashcard
		  id:: 63dc0fd6-05f1-4bb3-8413-2eae63a33578
			- Tuples
			  
			  Tuples are subtypes of `array`. They’re a special way to type arrays that have fixed lengths, where the values at each index have specific, known types. Unlike most other types, tuples have to be explicitly typed when you declare them. That’s because the JavaScript syntax is the same for tuples and arrays (both use square brackets), and TypeScript already has rules for inferring array types from square brackets:
