		- What are the most proper versioning numbers? #flashcard
			- Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
			  
			  
			  MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
			  MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible
			  manner
			  PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
			  
			  
			  Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions
			  to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
