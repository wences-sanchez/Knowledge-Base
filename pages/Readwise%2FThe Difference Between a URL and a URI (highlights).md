		- The difference between a `URI` and a `URL` is that a `URI` can be just a name by itself (`google.com`) or a name combined with a protocol (`https://google.com`)—while a `URL` is **always** a name combined with a protocol.
		  
		  A URI is like an address by itself **or** an address with directions, while a URL is **always** an address *with directions*.
		  
		  All URLs are URIs, but not all URIs are URLs. #flashcard

		- In other words, URIs are identifiers, and URLs are identifiers **that also tell you how to reach them**.
		  
		  •   google.com …is a `URI` because it is **only the name** of a resource
		  •   https://google.com …is a `URL` because it’s both the name **and the way to get there**
		  
		  Those are the basics, but read below to get far more technical detail about the difference between URIs and URLs, as well as URNs.
