		- **Inventories** are how Ansible locate and run against multiple systems.
		- You can think of an inventory as a list of hosts

		- When you are in the CLI, you have to specify the hosts against the control node will run and the module (with **-m**). It could be a built-in module.
			- You can specify a custom inventory of yours (instead of the default) with the **-i** option.
