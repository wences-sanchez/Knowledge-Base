	- ### Inventories
		- **Inventories** are how Ansible locate and run against multiple systems.
		- You can think of an inventory as a list of hosts
		- Inventories are located in `/etc/ansible/hosts`, but that is configurable
		- It could be formatted as an INI file or as a YAML file
	-
		- When you are in the CLI, you have to specify the hosts against the control node will run and the module (with **-m**). It could be a built-in module.
			- You can specify a custom inventory of yours (instead of the default) with the **-i** option.

		- Talk about *inventories* in Ansible, how do we deal with them and where they are. Also how they are called. #flashcard

	- ### Modules
		- **Modules** are essentially tools for particular tasks
		- **Modules** (usually) take parameters
		- They can run from the comamnd line or within a playbook
		- There are a significant number of modules for many kinds of work
		-
	- ### Variables
		- Typically used for configuration values and various parameters
		- Ansible variables may also be dictionaries.
	-
	- ### Facts
		- Facts provide certain information about a given target host.
		- Facts are discovered by Ansible automatically when it reaches out to a host
			- Fact gathering may be disabled
			- It can be slow, but it retrieves the facts at that time and if you use variables you should use it.

	- ### Plays and Playbooks
		- The goal of a **play** is to map a group of hosts to some well-defined **roles**
		- A **play** may use one or more modules to achieve a desired state on a **group of hosts**
		- A **playbook** is a series of **plays**
		- A **playbook** may deploy new web servers, install a new application to existing application servers, and run SQL against some database servers to support the new application.

	- ### Configuration Files
		- Several possible locations (in order processed):
			- 1. ANSIBLE_CONFIG (an environment variable)
			  2. ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
			  3. .ansible.cfg (in the home directory)
			  4. /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
			- If one found, the process stops.
		- Configuration can also be set in environment variables
		-
	- ### Ansible Configuration File
		- It's in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`
		- You should read the file comprehensively and make little edits in it.

		- Las variables de Ansible, ¿pueden ser globales, de alguna manera? #flashcard
			- Sí, puedes definir variables para un solo grupo de hosts, por ejemplo.
				- Puedes definirla para el grupo *default*, y así sería global a todos los hosts.
			- También puedes usar variables de entorno del sistema como variables globales.
		- Si uso una variable en un play, ¿será esta global? :: No, estará limitada al play y no podrá usarse fuera ni en el mismo playbook.
		- Ansible variables, are they global? #flashcard
			- Short answer: yes
			- Long answer: they can be scoped to specific groups and hosts.
