	- About particle-wave duality #flashcard
		- We conclude the following: The electrons arrive in lumps, like particles, and the probability of arrival of these lumps is distributed like the distribution of intensity of a wave. It is in this sense that an electron behaves "sometimes like a particle and sometimes like a wave.'

	- What happens when we "see" the electron experiment? #flashcard
		- If we now repeat such a measurement for many values of x, we get the curves for P and P, shown in part (b) of Fig. 1-4.
		  
		  Well, that is not too surprising! We get for P something quite similar to what we got before for P by blocking off hole 2; and P is similar to what we got by blocking hole 1. So there is not any complicated business like going through both holes. When we watch them, the electrons come through just as we would expect them to come through. Whether the holes are closed or open, those which we see come through hole 1 are distributed in the same way whether hole 2 is 66 open or closed.

	- Sobre el principio de Incertidumbre de Heisenberg #flashcard
		- The complete theory of quantum mechanics which we now use to describe atoms and, in fact, all matter, depends on the correctness of the uncertainty principle. Since quantum mechanics is such a successful theory, our belief in the uncertainty principle is reinforced. But if a way to "beat" the uncertainty principle were ever discovered, quantum mechanics would give inconsistent results and would have to be discarded as a valid theory of nature.

	- About interpretations #flashcard
		- What we must say (to avoid making wrong predictions) is the following. If one looks at the holes or, more accurately, if one has a piece of apparatus which is capable of determining whether the electrons go through hole 1 or hole 2, then one can say that it goes either through hole 1 or hole 2. But, when one does not try to tell which way the electron goes, when there is nothing in the experiment to disturb the electrons, then one may not say that an electron goes either through hole 1 or hole 2. If one does say that, and starts to make any deductions from the statement, he will make errors in the analysis. This is the logical tightrope on which we must walk if we wish to describe nature successfully.

	- About Quantum History #flashcard
		- The uncertainty principle "protects" quantum mechanics. Heisenberg recognized that if it were possible to measure the momentum and the position simultaneously with a greater accuracy, the quantum mechanics would collapse.
		  
		  So he proposed that it must be impossible. Then people sat down and tried to figure out ways of doing it, and nobody could figure out a way to measure the position and the momentum of anything-a screen, an electron, a billiard ball, anything-with any greater accuracy. Quantum mechanics maintains its perilous but still correct existece.
