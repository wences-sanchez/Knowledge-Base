	- I can never be all the people I want and live all the lives I want. I can never train myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental and physical experience possible in my life. #spaced

	- Think slow and twice. Don't fail #flashcard
		- You know, the pub. Before you had it. This is the life you dreamed of. You wanted me and you wanted this and yet you’ve been unfaithful
		- ([Location 879](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=879))
		- #[[mind]]
	- This was not the life she imagined it to be. #spaced
		- ([Location 893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=893))
	- ‘It’s hard to predict, isn’t it?’ she asked, looking blankly in front of her as she moved a black bishop across the board to take a white pawn. ‘The things that will make us happy.’ #spaced
		- ([Location 911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=911))

		- ([Location 947](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=947))
	- Of course. In this life she’d never have done a Philosophy degree. While her root self had been reading the works of Thoreau and Lao Tzu and Sartre in a stinky student flat in Bristol, her current self had been standing on Olympic podiums #spaced
		- ([Location 1527](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=1527))

	- But the truth is that success is a delusion. It’s all a delusion. I mean, yes, there are things we can overcome. For instance, I am someone who gets stage fright and yet, here I am, on a stage. Look at me . . . on a stage! And someone told me recently, they told me that my problem isn’t actually stage fright. My problem is life fright. And you know what? They’re fucking right. Because life is frightening, and it is frightening for a reason, and the reason is that it doesn’t matter which branch of a life we get to live, we are always the same rotten tree. I wanted to be many things in my life. All kinds of things. But if your life is rotten, it will be rotten no matter what you do. The damp rots the whole useless thing . #spaced

		- #[[mind]]
	- It’s you, Nora. You are giving up at the worst possible moment. You can’t give up, Nora. You have more to offer. More opportunities to have. There are so many versions of you out there. Remember how you felt after the polar bear. Remember how much you wanted life.’ #spaced
		- ([Location 2628](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2628))
	- Equidistant. Equidistant. Equidistant. Not aligned to one bank or the other. That was how she had felt most of her life. Caught in the middle. Struggling, flailing, just trying to survive while not knowing which way to go. Which path to commit to without regret. #spaced
		- ([Location 2677](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2677))
	- ‘You might need to stop worrying about other people’s approval, Nora,’ Mrs Elm said in a whisper, for added power and intimacy. ‘You don’t need a permission slip to be your—’ ‘Yes. I get it.’ And she did get it. #spaced
		- ([Location 2706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2706))
	- Maybe there was no perfect life for her, but somewhere, surely, there was a life worth living. And if she was to find a life truly worth living, she realised she would have to cast a wider net. #spaced

	- ‘Look at how ordered and safe and peaceful it looks now, before a game starts. It’s a beautiful thing. But it is boring. It is dead. And yet the moment you make a move on that board, things change. Things begin to get more chaotic. And that chaos builds with every single move you make.’ #spaced
		- ([Location 2730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08543NK7K&location=2730))

	- She might not have felt everything she had felt in those lives, but she had the capability. She might have missed those particular opportunities that led her to become an Olympic swimmer, or a traveller, or a vineyard owner, or a rock star, or a planet-saving glaciologist, or a Cambridge graduate, or a mother, or the million other things, but she was still in some way all those people.

	- She opened the book and tried to find the first page. But the only difficulty was that there was no first page. There were no words in the entire book. It was completely blank. Like the other books, this was the book of her future. But unlike the others, in this one that future was unwritten. So, this was it. This was her life. Her root life. And it was a blank page. #spaced
