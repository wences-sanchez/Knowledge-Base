	- “To ash all things return, so too this flesh will burn. But I am Tehlu. Son of myself. Father of myself. I was before, and I will be after. If I am a sacrifice then it is to myself alone. And if I am needed and called in the proper ways then I will come again to judge and punish.” ([Location 3260](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003HV0TN2&location=3260))
	- I was finally a member of the Arcanum, in some ways exactly where I had always wanted to be. ([Location 5266](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003HV0TN2&location=5266))
	- “I used to do that for hours,” Elodin said, drawing a deep breath and looking around the room fondly. “Good times.” ([Location 6084](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003HV0TN2&location=6084))
	- Music is a proud, temperamental mistress. Give her the time and attention she deserves, and she is yours. Slight her and there will come a day when you call and she will not answer. So I began sleeping less to give her the time she needed. ([Location 6559](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003HV0TN2&location=6559))

	- Simmon looked a little shocked. “No wonder you look like you haven’t slept in a span of days,” he said. Wilem nodded to himself. “And you’re still working in Kilvin’s shop, aren’t you?” “A couple hours every night.” Simmon was aghast. “And you’re learning an instrument at the same time? Are you insane?” ([Location 6609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003HV0TN2&location=6609))

	- In the silence I felt it all unraveling, the audience waking with the dream unfinished, all my work ruined, wasted. And all the while burning inside me was the song, the song. The song! Without knowing what I did, I set my fingers back to the strings and fell deep into myself. Into years before, when my hands had calluses like stones and my music had come as easy as breathing. Back to the time I had played to make the sound of Wind Turning a Leaf on a lute with six strings. And I began to play. Slowly, then with greater speed as my hands remembered.

	- After all these years I finally had the opportunity to learn something about the Chandrian. And not just a mention of them pressed flat between the pages of a book in the Archives. I had the chance to see their work firsthand. This was an opportunity that might never come again. ([Location 9476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B003HV0TN2&location=9476))
