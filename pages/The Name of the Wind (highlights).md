		- Simmon looked a little shocked. “No wonder you look like you haven’t slept in a span of days,” he said. Wilem nodded to himself. “And you’re still working in Kilvin’s shop, aren’t you?” “A couple hours every night.” Simmon was aghast. “And you’re learning an instrument at the same time?

Back to the time I had played to make the sound of Wind Turning a Leaf on a lute with six strings. And I began to play. Slowly, then with greater speed as my hands remembered. #ñspace

	- About seizing opportunities #car
