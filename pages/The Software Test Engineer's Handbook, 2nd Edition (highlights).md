				- Minimum coverage is a term used to indicate when you have achieved test coverage with at least one test case defined for each condition or data set. Minimum coverage should not be the end goal, but it can be used as an indication that you have applied the technique and have identified the breadth of achievable coverage. According to the risks, achieving minimum coverage may not be sufficient and you will need to either add additional test cases using the same technique or combine techniques to create a richer and more varied set of tests.

				- never assume the requirements are complete. In this example, they have identified only three conditions that need to be tested, but we know that these three conditions can occur in any combination, so we actually need to test not just three condition combinations but eight combinations (Yes and No for each of the three conditions = 2 × 2 × 2).

			- It is difficult to design comprehensive decision tables if you don’t know what the software should do—so, the better the requirements, the more accurate the decision tables. #flashcard
