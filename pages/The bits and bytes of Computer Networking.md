	- ### The Network Layer
		- #### The Network Layer
			- On a LAN (Local Area Network), nodes can communicate with each other with their physical MAC addresses.
				- But MAC addressing isn't a scheme that scales well.
				- They aren't ordered in any systematic way
					- There is no way of knowing where on the planet a certain MAC address might be at any one point in time, so it's not ideal for communicating across distances.
				- We need another solution --> **That is the network layer**
				-
			- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
		- #### IP Addresses
			- IP addresses are a 32 bit long numbers made up of four octets (each octet is 8 bits).
				- They can represent all decimal numbers from 0 to 255.

				-
				-
			- IP addresses belong to networks, not to the devices attached to those networks.
				- My laptop will always have the same **MAC** address, but a different **IP** if I am in a cyber-cafe.
				- The **LAN** at the Internet cafe, or the **LAN** at your house would each be individually responsible for handing out an IP address to your laptop if you power it on there.
			-
			- IP addresses can be:
				- **Dynamic**: They will be assigned automatically through a technology known as **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol** (DHCP).
				-
				- **Static**: They must be configured on a node manually. In most cases they are reserved for servers and network devices, and dynamic for clients. But not alway.

		- #### IP Address Classes
			- IP addresses can be split into two sections:
				- the network ID, and
				- the host ID
			- In the example of IBM having all the IPs which start with 9,

			- The Address class system is a way of defining how the glogal IP address space is split up. Its types:
				- Class A:

				- Class B:
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1662200959197_0.png)
				- Class C:
					- ![image.png](../assets/image_1662201005683_0.png)
				- Table:

		- #### Address Resolution Protocol
			- **ARP** is a protocol used to discover the hardware address of a node with a certain IP address
			- An **ARP table** is a list of IP addresses and the MAC addresses associated with them.
			- Example:
				- The host A needs to know the MAC address of an IP
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1662201635737_0.png)
				- The host A sends a broadcast ARP message to the MAC broadcast address (which is all F's).
				- Delivered to all computers
				- ![image.png](../assets/image_1662201676119_0.png)
				- When the network interface with that IP receives the ARP broadcast, it sends back what is known as an ARP response.
				- This response message will contain the MAC address  for the network interface in question.

			- About LANs, their communication methods, and their problems. #flashcard
			  collapsed:: true
				- On a LAN (Local Area Network), nodes can communicate with each other with their physical MAC addresses.
					- But MAC addressing isn't a scheme that scales well.
					- They aren't ordered in any systematic way
						- There is no way of knowing where on the planet a certain MAC address might be at any one point in time, so it's not ideal for communicating across distances.
					- We need another solution --> **That is the network layer**
			- What is an IP and what can't be? #flashcard
			  collapsed:: true
				- IP addresses are a 32 bit long numbers made up of four octets (each octet is 8 bits).
					- They can represent all decimal numbers from 0 to 255.

			- Where do IP addresses belong? #flashcard
			  collapsed:: true
				- IP addresses belong to networks, not to the devices attached to those networks.
					- My laptop will always have the same **MAC** address, but a different **IP** if I am in a cyber-cafe.
					- The **LAN** at the Internet cafe, or the **LAN** at your house would each be individually responsible for handing out an IP address to your laptop if you power it on there.
			- Mention the two types of IP addresses. #flashcard
			  collapsed:: true
				- IP addresses can be:
					- **Dynamic**: They will be assigned automatically through a technology known as **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol** (DHCP).
					-
					- **Static**: They must be configured on a node manually. In most cases they are reserved for servers and network devices, and dynamic for clients. But not alway.

			- Example of ARP use case #spaced

				- The host A needs to know the MAC address of an IP

	- ### Subnetting
		- #### Subnetting
			- **Subnetting** is the process of taking a large network and splitting it up into many individual and smaller subnetworks, or subnets.
			- > Incorrect subnetting setups are a common problem you might run into as an IT Support Specialist, so it's important to have a strong understanding of how this works.
			- A **gateway** router specifically serves as the entry and exit path to a certain network. You can contrast this with core internet routers, which might only speak to other core routers.
			-
		- #### Subnet Masks
			- **Subnet masks** are 32-bit numbers that are normally written out as four octets in decimal.
