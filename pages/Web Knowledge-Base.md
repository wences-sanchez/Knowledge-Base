		- In fact, quantum mechanics covers the very little, besides affects everything -- since everything is composed by its little pieces.
			- > Quantum mechanics is a subfield of physics that describes the behavior of particles ‚Äî atoms, electrons, photons and almost everything in the molecular and submolecular realm.  [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-quantum-mechanics-1853f27d901#8277c8ac-c9cc-4857-bedc-a10418f20185)
		- Who was the first person in pointing quantum mechanics?
			- > It started at the turn of the 20th century, around the same time Albert Einstein published his theory of relativity, a separate revolution in physics that describes the motion of things at high speeds.

		- > What is wave-particle duality?
		  Here is a diagram of the double-slit experiment where electrons produce a wave pattern when two slits are used. (Image credit: grayjay via Shutterstock) [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-quantum-mechanics-1853f27d901#f0b867b3-07b2-4f1a-bbfb-f3b47b9df07b)
		- > In quantum mechanics, particles can sometimes exist as waves and sometimes exist as particles. This can be most famously seen in the double-slit experiment, where particles such as electrons are shot at a board with two slits cut into it, behind which sits a screen that lights up when an electron hits it. If the electrons were particles, they would create two bright lines where they had impacted the screen after passing through one or the other of the slits, according to a popular article in Nature [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-quantum-mechanics-1853f27d901#b49174cb-c7c0-4121-b776-9f57c345e986)
		- > What is the Schr√∂dinger's cat paradox?
		  Schr√∂dinger's cat is an often-misunderstood thought experiment describing the qualms that some of the early developers of quantum mechanics had with its results. While Bohr and many of his students believed that quantum mechanics suggested that particles don't have well-defined properties until they are observed, Schr√∂dinger and Einstein were unable to believe such a possibility because it would lead to ridiculous conclusions about the nature of reality. In 1935, Schr√∂dinger proposed an experiment in which the life or death of a cat would depend on the random flip of a quantum particle, whose state would remain unseen until a box was opened. Schr√∂dinger hoped to show the absurdity of Bohr's ideas with a real-world example that depended on the probabilistic nature of a quantum particle but yielded a nonsensical result.
		  According to Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics, until the box was opened, the cat existed in the impossible dual position of being both alive and dead at the same time. (No actual cat has ever been subjected to this experiment.) Both Schr√∂dinger and Einstein believed that this helped show that quantum mechanics was an incomplete theory and would eventually be superseded by one that accorded with ordinary experience.

		- > Schr√∂dinger and Einstein helped highlight another strange result of quantum mechanics that neither could fully fathom. [‚§¥Ô∏è](https://omnivore.app/me/what-is-quantum-mechanics-1853f27d901#0b85899e-16ca-40df-81ba-0d0032cfbb4c)
